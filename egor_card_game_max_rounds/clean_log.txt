This ensures maximum rounds and efficiency. We will use only Python\'s standard library (no need for external open-source libraries due to the problem\'s nature and for simplicity).

Yes. The code is implemented as per the requirements: it provides a CLI tool for the Egor card game, supports batch input, optional verbose mode, and clear error messages. The logic for parsing, validating, and processing test cases is modular and separated into appropriate classes.\n2. Yes. The code logic is correct for parsing input, validating test cases, invoking the game logic, and outputting results. Error handling is robust and clear.\n3. Yes. The code follows the specified "Data structures and interfaces": InputHandler, OutputHandler, EgorGame, and Main classes are present and their methods match the design.\n4. Yes. All required functions are implemented: parse_input, validate_test_case, print_results, print_error, max_winning_rounds, and main.\n5. Yes. All necessary pre-dependencies (sys, typing) are imported.\n6. No. The EgorGame class is re-implemented in main.py instead of being imported from egor_game.py as per the modular design. To fix this:\n   - Remove the EgorGame class definition from main.py.\n   - Add `from egor_game import EgorGame` at the top of main.py.\n   - Ensure egor_game.py is in the same directory or in the Python path.\n\n## Actions\n1. Remove the EgorGame class from main.py.\n2. Add `from egor_game import EgorGame` at the top of main.py.\n3. Ensure that only one implementation of EgorGame exists (in egor_game.py), and main.py uses it via import.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite main.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## main.py\n...\n```\n'}]

The core challenge is to partition the deck into the maximum number of contiguous, non-overlapping segments (rounds) such that the sum of each segment is within [l, r]. Given the constraints (large n, multiple test cases), we will use a greedy two-pointer (sliding window) approach: for each test case, iterate through the deck, expanding the window to find the smallest valid segment, then move to the next card after the segment. This ensures maximum rounds and efficiency. We will use only Python\'s standard library (no need for external open-source libraries due to the problem\'s nature and for simplicity). The CLI will support batch input, optional verbose mode, and clear error messages for invalid input.
