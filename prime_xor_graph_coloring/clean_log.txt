For each test case, we will analyze the structure: for small n, we can build the adjacency list and use a greedy coloring; for large n, we exploit the fact that the graph is highly sparse and symmetric, and in practice, it is always bipartite (2-colorable) for n >= 2, since all primes > 2 are odd and XOR with 1 flips parity. We will verify this property and use a simple 2-coloring (alternating colors) for all n > 2, and handle n=1,2 as special cases. We will use only standard Python libraries (no external dependencies) for maximum portability and clarity.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class PrimeSieve {\\n        -max_n: int\\n        -is_prime: list[bool]\\n        +__init__(self, max_n: int)\\n        +get_primes(self) -> list[int]\\n        +is_prime_number(self, x: int) -> bool\\n    }\\n    class GraphColoringSolver {\\n        -sieve: PrimeSieve\\n        +__init__(self, max_n: int)\\n        +min_colors(self, n: int) -> int\\n        +coloring(self, n: int) -> list[int]\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +run(self)\\n    }\\n    Main --> GraphColoringSolver\\n    GraphColoringSolver --> PrimeSieve\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant S as GraphColoringSolver\\n    participant P as PrimeSieve\\n    M->>P: __init__(max_n)\\n    M->>S: __init__(max_n)\\n    loop For each test case\\n        M->>S: min_colors(n)\\n        S->>P: (internal, if needed) is_prime_number(x)\\n        S-->>M: return k\\n        M->>S: coloring(n)\\n        S-->>M: return coloring_list\\n        M-->>M: print output for test case\\n    end\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The requirements are clear.
