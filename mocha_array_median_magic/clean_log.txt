can be shown that the maximum value that can be achieved is the maximum value that appears at least twice in the array, or the maximum value itself if it appears only once at the ends. We
 will process each test case efficiently by counting occurrences and checking the positions of the maximum value. No external libraries are needed beyond Python's standard library. The pr

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses a single file, modularizes the logic into `MochaArrayMedianMagic` and `Main` classes, and processes input/output as descri
bed.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. The approach for finding the maximum value that can be made uniform is sound and matches the described algorithm.
3. Yes, the code follows the described "Data structures and interfaces". The class and method signatures match the design.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented as required.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies are imported. Only standard library modules are used.
6. Yes, methods from other classes in the same file are reused correctly.
