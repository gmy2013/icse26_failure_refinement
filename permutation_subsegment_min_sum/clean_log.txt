For each removal, we will efficiently update the answer by considering only the affected subsegments. The key insight is that for a permutation, the position of each value is unique, and the contribution of each element to f(a) can be calculated as the product of the number of subarrays where it is the minimum. When an element is removed, only the subarrays containing it are affected. We will precompute, for each element, its left and right boundaries (using monotonic stacks) where it is the minimum, and use prefix sums to quickly update f(b) for each removal. We will use only standard Python libraries (collections, bisect, etc.) for maximum portability and simplicity, as no external open-source library is needed for this algorithmic task.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class PermutationSubsegmentMinSum {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +process_test_case(n: int, a: list[int]) -> list[int]\\n        +compute_f(a: list[int]) -> int\\n        +compute_contributions(a: list[int]) -> tuple[list[int], list[int], list[int]]\\n        +solve(t: int, test_cases: list[tuple[int, list[int]]]) -> list[list[int]]\\n    }\\n    class InputParser {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +read_input() -> tuple[int, list[tuple[int, list[int]]]]\\n    }\\n    class OutputFormatter {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +format_output(results: list[list[int]]) -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> PermutationSubsegmentMinSum\\n    Main --> InputParser\\n    Main --> OutputFormatter\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant IP as InputParser\\n    participant PSM as PermutationSubsegmentMinSum\\n    participant OF as OutputFormatter\\n    M->>IP: read_input()\\n    IP-->>M: t, test_cases\\n    M->>PSM: solve(t, test_cases)\\n    PSM->>PSM: process_test_case(n, a) for each test case\\n    PSM->>PSM: compute_contributions(a)\\n    PSM->>PSM: compute_f(a)\\n    PSM-->>M: results\\n    M->>OF: format_output(results)\\n    OF-->>M: (prints output)\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The main challenge is ensuring that the update to f(b) for each removal is done in O(1) or O(log n) per element, not O(n).
