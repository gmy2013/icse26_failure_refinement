The core challenge is to maximize the expected value, which is defined as the product of the probabilities of all selected games times the sum of their winnings. Since the \'all or nothing\' rule applies, the optimal subset is a prefix of the games sorted by a certain criterion. After analysis, the optimal strategy is to sort the games by decreasing \'w_i * (p_i / 100) / (1 - p_i / 100)\' (i.e., the ratio of expected marginal gain to the risk of losing), and then greedily add games to the subset as long as the expected value increases. We will use high-precision floating-point arithmetic (Python\'s float is sufficient for 1e-6 error) and a simple command-line interface for input/output. The code will be modular, with a Game class and a CasinoMaxExpectedValue class to encapsulate logic. The UI will be a minimal CLI as per requirements.","File list":["main.py","casino.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Game {\\n        -int p  # probability (1-100)\\n        -int w  # winnings\\n        +__init__(self, p: int, w: int)\\n        +prob(self) float  # returns p/100\\n        +expected_value(self) float  # returns w * p/100\\n    }\\n    class CasinoMaxExpectedValue {\\n        -List[Game] games\\n        +__init__(self, games: List[Game])\\n        +max_expected_value(self) float  # main algorithm\\n        +select_optimal_subset(self) List[int]  # optional: indices of selected games\\n    }\\n    class CLI {\\n        +run(self)\\n        +parse_input(self) List[Game]\\n        +display_output(self, value: float)\\n    }\\n    CLI --> CasinoMaxExpectedValue\\n    CasinoMaxExpectedValue --> Game\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant U as User\\n    participant CLI as CLI\\n    participant C as CasinoMaxExpectedValue\\n    participant G as Game\\n    U->>CLI: run()\\n    CLI->>CLI: parse_input()\\n    CLI->>G: __init__(p, w) (for each game)\\n    CLI-->>C: CasinoMaxExpectedValue(games)\\n    C->>C: max_expected_value()\\n    C-->>CLI: return max_expected_value\\n    CLI->>CLI: display_output(value)\\n    CLI-->>U: output result\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The optimal algorithm is not explicitly specified in the requirements, but based on problem analysis, the greedy prefix approach is optimal for this scenario.
