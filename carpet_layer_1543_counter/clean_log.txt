If there are multiple such countries, output the smallest one. If no such country exists, output $-1$. The first line contains three integers $n$, $k$, and $q$ ($1 \\leq n, k, q \\leq 10^5$) — the number of countries, regions, and queries, respectively.Next, there are $n$ lines, where the $i$-th line contains $k$ integers $a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\dots, a_{i,k}$ ($1 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 10^9$), where $a_{i,j}$ is the value of the $j$-th region of the $i$-th country.Then, $q$ queries are described.The first line of each query contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$) — the number of requirements.Then follow $m$ lines, each containing an integer $r$, a character $o$, and an integer $c$ ($1 \\leq r \\leq k$, $0 \\leq c \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^9$), where $r$ and $c$ are the region number and the value, and $o$ is either $<$ or $>$ — the sign.It is guaranteed that $n \\cdot k$ does not exceed $10^5$ and that the sum of $m$ across all queries also does not exceed $10^5$. For each query, output a single integer on a new line — the smallest number of the suitable country, or $-1$ if no such country exists.\n\n### Search Information\n-\n\n\n-----\n\n## format example\n[CONTENT]\n{\n    "Language": "en_us",\n    "Programming Language": "Python",\n    "Original Requirements": "Create a 2048 game",\n    "Project Name": "game_2048",\n    "Product Goals": [\n        "Create an engaging user experience",\n        "Improve accessibility, be responsive",\n        "More beautiful UI"\n    ],\n    "User Stories": [\n        "As a player, I want to be able to choose difficulty levels",\n        "As a player, I want to see my score after each game",\n        "As a player, I want to get restart button when I lose",\n        "As a player, I want to see beautiful UI that make me feel good",\n        "As a player, I want to play game via mobile phone"\n    ],\n    "Competitive Analysis": [\n        "2048 Game A: Simple interface, lacks responsive features",\n        "play2048.co: Beautiful and responsive UI with my best score shown",\n        "2048game.com: Responsive UI with my best score shown, but many ads"\n    ],\n    "Competitive Quadrant Chart": "quadrantChart\\n    title \\"Reach and engagement of campaigns\\"\\n    x-axis \\"Low Reach\\" --> \\"High Reach\\"\\n    y-axis \\"Low Engagement\\" --> \\"High Engagement\\"\\n    quadrant-1 \\"We should expand\\"\\n    quadrant-2 \\"Need to promote\\"\\n    quadrant-3 \\"Re-evaluate\\"\\n    quadrant-4 \\"May be improved\\"\\n    \\"Campaign A\\": [0.3, 0.6]\\n    \\"Campaign B\\": [0.45, 0.23]\\n    \\"Campaign C\\": [0.57, 0.69]\\n    \\"Campaign D\\": [0.78, 0.34]\\n    \\"Campaign E\\": [0.40, 0.34]\\n    \\"Campaign F\\": [0.35, 0.78]\\n    \\"Our Target Product\\": [0.5, 0.6]",\n    "Requirement Analysis": "",\n    "Requirement Pool": [\n        [\n            "P0",\n            "The main code ..."\n        ],\n        [\n            "P0",\n            "The game algorithm ..."\n        ]\n    ],\n    "UI Design draft": "Basic function description with a simple style and layout.",\n    "Anything UNCLEAR": ""\n}\n[/CONTENT]\n\n## nodes: "<node>: <type>  # <instruction>"\n- Language: <class \'str\'>  # Provide the language used in the project, typically matching the user\'s requirement language.\n- Programming Language: <class \'str\'>  # Python/JavaScript or other mainstream programming language.\n- Original Requirements: <class \'str\'>  # Place the original user\'s requirements here.\n- Project Name: <class \'str\'>  # According to the content of "Original Requirements," name the project using snake case style , like \'game_2048\' or \'simple_crm.\n- Product Goals: typing.List[str]  # Provide up to three clear, orthogonal product goals.\n- User Stories: typing.List[str]  # Provide up to 3 to 5 scenario-based user stories.\n- Competitive Analysis: typing.List[str]  # Provide 5 to 7 competitive products.\n- Competitive Quadrant Chart: <class \'str\'>  # Use mermaid quadrantChart syntax.

But before implementing their grand plan, they decided to carefully think through their strategy — that's what sages do.There are $n$ countries, each with exactly $k$ regions. For the $j$-th region of the $i$-th country, they calculated the value $a_{i,j}$, which reflects the amount of water in it.The sages intend to create channels between the $j$-th region of the $i$-th country and the $j$-th region of the $(i + 1)$-th country for all $1 \leq i \leq (n - 1)$ and for all $1 \leq j \leq k$.Since all $n$ countries are on a large slope, water flows towards the country with the highest number.

If $o$ = $<$, then in the $r$-th region of the country you choose, the new value must be strictly less than the limit $c$, and if $o$ = $>$, it must be strictly greater.In other words, the chosen country $i$ must satisfy all $m$ requirements. If in the current requirement $o$ = $<$, then it must hold that $b_{i,r} < c$, and if $o$ = $>$, then $b_{i,r} > c$.In response to each query, you should output a single integer — the number of the suitable country.

The first line contains three integers $n$, $k$, and $q$ ($1 \\leq n, k, q \\leq 10^5$) — the number of countries, regions, and queries, respectively.Next, there are $n$ lines, where the $i$-th line contains $k$ integers $a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\dots, a_{i,k}$ ($1 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 10^9$), where $a_{i,j}$ is the value of the $j$-th region of the $i$-th country.Then, $q$ queries are described.The first line of each query contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$) — the number of requirements.Then follow $m$ lines, each containing an integer $r$, a character $o$, and an integer $c$ ($1 \\leq r \\leq k$, $0 \\leq c \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^9$), where $r$ and $c$ are the region number and the value, and $o$ is either $<$ or $>$ — the sign.It is guaranteed that $n \\cdot k$ does not exceed $10^5$ and that the sum of $m$ across all queries also does not exceed $10^5$.

For each query, output a single integer on a new line — the smallest number of the suitable country, or $-1$ if no such country exists.\n\n### Search Information\n-\n\n\n-----\n\n## format example\n[CONTENT]\n{\n    "Language": "en_us",\n    "Programming Language": "Python",\n    "Original Requirements": "Create a 2048 game",\n    "Project Name": "game_2048",\n    "Product Goals": [\n        "Create an engaging user experience",\n        "Improve accessibility, be responsive",\n        "More beautiful UI"\n    ],\n    "User Stories": [\n        "As a player, I want to be able to choose difficulty levels",\n        "As a player, I want to see my score after each game",\n        "As a player, I want to get restart button when I lose",\n        "As a player, I want to see beautiful UI that make me feel good",\n        "As a player, I want to play game via mobile phone"\n    ],\n    "Competitive Analysis": [\n        "2048 Game A: Simple interface, lacks responsive features",\n        "play2048.co: Beautiful and responsive UI with my best score shown",\n        "2048game.com: Responsive UI with my best score shown, but many ads"\n    ],\n    "Competitive Quadrant Chart": "quadrantChart\\n    title \\"Reach and engagement of campaigns\\"\\n    x-axis \\"Low Reach\\" --> \\"High Reach\\"\\n    y-axis \\"Low Engagement\\" --> \\"High Engagement\\"\\n    quadrant-1 \\"We should expand\\"\\n    quadrant-2 \\"Need to promote\\"\\n    quadrant-3 \\"Re-evaluate\\"\\n    quadrant-4 \\"May be improved\\"\\n    \\"Campaign A\\": [0.3, 0.6]\\n    \\"Campaign B\\": [0.45, 0.23]\\n    \\"Campaign C\\": [0.57, 0.69]\\n    \\"Campaign D\\": [0.78, 0.34]\\n    \\"Campaign E\\": [0.40, 0.34]\\n    \\"Campaign F\\": [0.35, 0.78]\\n    \\"Our Target Product\\": [0.5, 0.6]",\n    "Requirement Analysis": "",\n    "Requirement Pool": [\n        [\n            "P0",\n            "The main code ..."\n        ],\n        [\n            "P0",\n            "The game algorithm ..."\n        ]\n    ],\n    "UI Design draft": "Basic function description with a simple style and layout.",\n    "Anything UNCLEAR": ""\n}\n[/CONTENT]\n\n## nodes: "<node>: <type>  # <instruction>"\n- Language: <class \'str\'>  # Provide the language used in the project, typically matching the user\'s requirement language.\n- Programming Language: <class \'str\'>  # Python/JavaScript or other mainstream programming language.\n- Original Requirements: <class \'str\'>  # Place the original user\'s requirements here.\n- Project Name: <class \'str\'>  # According to the content of "Original Requirements," name the project using snake case style , like \'game_2048\' or \'simple_crm.\n- Product Goals: typing.List[str]  # Provide up to three clear, orthogonal product goals.\n- User Stories: typing.List[str]  # Provide up to 3 to 5 scenario-based user stories.\n- Competitive Analysis: typing.List[str]  # Provide 5 to 7 competitive products.\n- Competitive Quadrant Chart: <class \'str\'>  # Use mermaid quadrantChart syntax.

    "Original Requirements": "A conspiracy of ancient sages, who decided to redirect rivers for their own convenience, has put the world on the brink. But before implementing their grand plan, they decided to carefully think through their strategy — that's what sages do.There are $n$ countries, each with exactly $k$ regions. For the $j$-th region of the $i$-th country, they calculated the value $a_{i,j}$, which reflects the amount of water in it.The sages intend to create channels between the $j$-th region of the $i$-th country and the $j$-th region of the $(i + 1)$-th country for all $1 \leq i \leq (n - 1)$ and for all $1 \leq j \leq k$.Since all $n$ countries are on a large slope, water flows towards the country with the highest number. According to the sages' predictions, after the channel system is created, the new value of the $j$-th region of the $i$-th country will be $b_{i,j} = a_{1,j} | a_{2,j} | ... | a_{i,j}$, where $|$ denotes the [bitwise OR](http://tiny.cc/bitwise_or) operation.After the redistribution of water, the sages aim to choose the most suitable country for living, so they will send you $q$ queries for consideration.Each query will contain $m$ requirements.Each requirement contains three parameters: the region number $r$, the sign $o$ (either $<$ or $>$), and the value $c$. If $o$ = $<$, then in the $r$-th region of the country you choose, the new value must be strictly less than the limit $c$, and if $o$ = $>$, it must be strictly greater.In other words, the chosen country $i$ must satisfy all $m$ requirements. If in the current requirement $o$ = $<$, then it must hold that $b_{i,r} < c$, and if $o$ = $>$, then $b_{i,r} > c$.In response to each query, you should output a single integer — the number of the suitable country. If there are multiple such countries, output the smallest one. If no such country exists, output $-1$. The first line contains three integers $n$, $k$, and $q$ ($1 \leq n, k, q \leq 10^5$) — the number of countries, regions, and queries, respectively.Next, there are $n$ lines, where the $i$-th line contains $k$ integers $a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \dots, a_{i,k}$ ($1 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^9$), where $a_{i,j}$ is the value of the $j$-th region of the $i$-th country.Then, $q$ queries are described.The first line of each query contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^5$) — the number of requirements.Then follow $m$ lines, each containing an integer $r$, a character $o$, and an integer $c$ ($1 \leq r \leq k$, $0 \leq c \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$), where $r$ and $c$ are the region number and the value, and $o$ is either $<$ or $>$ — the sign.It is guaranteed that $n \cdot k$ does not exceed $10^5$ and that the sum of $m$ across all queries also does not exceed $10^5$. For each query, output a single integer on a new line — the smallest number of the suitable country, or $-1$ if no such country exists.",

    "Requirement Analysis": "The requirements focus on efficiently processing a large number of queries, each with multiple conditions, over a matrix of water values for regions in countries. The main challenge is to compute the bitwise OR prefix for each region across countries and then, for each query, quickly determine the smallest country index that satisfies all requirements. The constraints on n, k, and q, as well as the total number of requirements, necessitate an optimized approach both in preprocessing (to compute b_{i,j}) and in query evaluation (to avoid redundant computation). The system must also be robust to handle edge cases, such as no country meeting the requirements.",

The output area displays the result for each query. The layout is simple, focusing on usability and clarity, with clear instructions and error prompts.",
    "Anything UNCLEAR": "No major ambiguities, but clarification on whether queries can be processed in parallel or must be sequential would help optimize further."
