We will precompute the prime factors of x and, for each card, track the exponents of these factors in its value. We will use a sliding window or greedy partitioning: as we process the array, we maintain a running product\'s factorization, and whenever it becomes possible to form x (i.e., all required exponents are met), we start a new segment. We will use the \'sympy\' library for efficient prime factorization. The command-line interface will be simple, reading from stdin and outputting results to stdout, with clear error handling and documentation.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class BadSegmentSolver {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +min_bad_segments(n: int, x: int, a: list[int]) int\\n        +_prime_factors(num: int) dict[int, int]\\n        +_get_exponents(a: int, x_factors: dict[int, int]) dict[int, int]\\n    }\\n    class MainApp {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +run() None\\n        +_parse_input() tuple\\n        +_print_output(results: list[int]) None\\n    }\\n    MainApp --> BadSegmentSolver\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant MA as MainApp\\n    participant BS as BadSegmentSolver\\n    MA->>MA: _parse_input()\\n    MA->>BS: __init__()\\n    loop For each test case\\n        MA->>BS: min_bad_segments(n, x, a)\\n        BS->>BS: _prime_factors(x)\\n        loop For each a_i in a\\n            BS->>BS: _get_exponents(a_i, x_factors)\\n        end\\n        BS-->>MA: return min_segments\\n    end\\n    MA->>MA: _print_output(results)\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The definition of a \'bad segment\' is clear, but the optimal partitioning strategy (greedy, DP, or otherwise) is not specified in the requirements.
