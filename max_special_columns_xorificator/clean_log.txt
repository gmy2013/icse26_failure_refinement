    "Implementation approach": "We will process each test case independently, leveraging the fact that inverting a row is equivalent to flipping all its bits. The key insight is that for
each column, the set of rows containing 1s can be made to have exactly one 1 by choosing a subset of rows to flip. For each possible pattern of a column (i.e., the vector of bits in that
column), we can count how many columns share that pattern. By considering all possible row flip combinations (which is feasible since we only need to consider unique column patterns, not
all 2^n combinations), we can, for each possible row flip mask, count how many columns become 'special' (i.e., have exactly one 1 after flipping). We use a Counter to group columns by the
ir bit patterns, and for each possible row flip mask, we compute the number of special columns. The optimal mask and its count are tracked. The solution is implemented in pure Python, usi
ng only the standard library (collections.Counter, itertools), as no external libraries are needed for this logic. The code is structured for clarity and efficiency, with a main.py entry
point and a solver module.",

## Code Review: solver.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It processes each test case independently, groups columns by their bit patterns, and finds the optimal row flip mask to maximize t
he number of special columns.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. It exhaustively checks all possible row flip masks and correctly counts the number of special columns for each mask.
3. Yes, the code follows the specified data structures and interfaces. The `MatrixXORSolver` class and its methods match the design, and the method signatures are as described.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented as required: `__init__`, `solve`, `_columns_to_patterns`, and `_find_optimal_flip`.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies (`collections.Counter`, `itertools.product`, and typing annotations) are imported.
6. Yes, the code is modular and ready to be reused by other files (e.g., `main.py`).
