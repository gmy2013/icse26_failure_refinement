The core challenge is efficient enumeration of all valid minimal attack plans, which involves combinatorial geometry and dynamic programming. We will use numpy for efficient geometric calculations and itertools for combinatorial enumeration. For the UI, we will use Streamlit for a simple, interactive web interface. The system will be structured into modules: geometry (for geometric predicates and operations), attack_plan (for the main DP/enumeration logic), and ui (for user interaction). The system will handle edge cases (impossible configurations) and provide clear feedback. For large inputs, we will optimize geometric checks and use memoization.

The core challenge is efficient enumeration of all valid minimal attack plans, which involves combinatorial geometry and dynamic programming. We will use numpy for efficient geometric calculations and itertools for combinatorial enumeration. For the UI, we will use Streamlit for a simple, interactive web interface. The system will be structured into modules: geometry (for geometric predicates and operations), attack_plan (for the main DP/enumeration logic), and ui (for user interaction). The system will handle edge cases (impossible configurations) and provide clear feedback. For large inputs, we will optimize geometric checks and use memoization.

The core challenge is efficient enumeration of all valid minimal attack plans, which involves combinatorial geometry and dynamic programming. We will use numpy for efficient geometric calculations and itertools for combinatorial enumeration. For the UI, we will use Streamlit for a simple, interactive web interface. The system will be structured into modules: geometry (for geometric predicates and operations), attack_plan (for the main DP/enumeration logic), and ui (for user interaction). The system will handle edge cases (impossible configurations) and provide clear feedback. For large inputs, we will optimize geometric checks and use memoization.

The system will be structured into modules: geometry (for geometric predicates and operations), attack_plan (for the main DP/enumeration logic), and ui (for user interaction). The system will handle edge cases (impossible configurations) and provide clear feedback. For large inputs, we will optimize geometric checks and use memoization.
