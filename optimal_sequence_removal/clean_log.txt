    "Implementation approach": "We will use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to efficiently compute both the minimum cost and the number of optimal sequences for removing all elements from array a. The main challenge is to handle the two types of operations (increment k and remove prefix) and to efficiently manage the DP state space given the large constraints. We will precompute prefix sums for array a to allow O(1) range sum queries. For each position in a and each possible k (1 <= k <= m), we will maintain the minimum cost to remove the suffix starting at that position with current k, and the number of ways to achieve that cost. We will use a single DP table of size n+1 by m+1 (where n is the length of a and m is the length of b), but optimize memory by only keeping two rows (current and next) at a time. For each state, we consider both possible operations: incrementing k (if k < m), or removing a prefix (using binary search on prefix sums to find the maximal removable prefix for current b_k). We will use the bisect module from Python's standard library for efficient prefix sum lookups. The solution will be implemented in pure Python, using only standard libraries for performance and compatibility.",

The main challenge is to handle the two types of operations (increment k and remove prefix) and to efficiently manage the DP state space given the large constraints. We will precompute prefix sums for array a to allow O(1) range sum queries. For each position in a and each possible k (1 <= k <= m), we will maintain the minimum cost to remove the suffix starting at that position with current k, and the number of ways to achieve that cost. We will use a single DP table of size n+1 by m+1 (where n is the length of a and m is the length of b), but optimize memory by only keeping two rows (current and next) at a time. For each state, we consider both possible operations: incrementing k (if k < m), or removing a prefix (using binary search on prefix sums to find the maximal removable prefix for current b_k). We will use the bisect module from Python\'s standard library for efficient prefix sum lookups. The solution will be implemented in pure Python, using only standard libraries for performance and compatibility.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class SequenceRemover {\\n        +__init__(self, a: List[int], b: List[int])\\n        +min_cost_and_count(self) -> Tuple[int, int]\\n    }\\n    class PrefixSum {\\n        +__init__(self, arr: List[int])\\n        +sum(self, l: int, r: int) -> int\\n        +find_max_prefix(self, start: int, limit: int) -> int\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +read_input() -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[List[int], List[int]]]]\\n        +process_cases(cases: List[Tuple[List[int], List[int]]]) -> List[Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]]\\n        +print_output(results: List[Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]])\\n    }\\n    Main --> SequenceRemover\\n    SequenceRemover --> PrefixSum\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant SR as SequenceRemover\\n    participant PS as PrefixSum\\n    M->>M: read_input()\\n    M->>SR: __init__(a, b)\\n    SR->>PS: __init__(a)\\n    M->>SR: min_cost_and_count()\\n    SR->>PS: find_max_prefix(start, limit)\\n    PS-->>SR: return max_prefix_index\\n    SR-->>M: return (min_cost, count) or -1\\n    M->>M: print_output(results)\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The requirements are mostly clear.

The main challenge is to handle the two types of operations (increment k and remove prefix) and to efficiently manage the DP state space given the large constraints. We will precompute prefix sums for array a to allow O(1) range sum queries. For each position in a and each possible k (1 <= k <= m), we will maintain the minimum cost to remove the suffix starting at that position with current k, and the number of ways to achieve that cost. We will use a single DP table of size n+1 by m+1 (where n is the length of a and m is the length of b), but optimize memory by only keeping two rows (current and next) at a time. For each state, we consider both possible operations: incrementing k (if k < m), or removing a prefix (using binary search on prefix sums to find the maximal removable prefix for current b_k). We will use the bisect module from Python\'s standard library for efficient prefix sum lookups.
