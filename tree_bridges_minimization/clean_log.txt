    "Implementation approach": "We will design an efficient, modular Python solution for the tree bridges minimization problem, focusing on O(n) or O(n log n) per testcase. The main chall
enge is to compute, for each k (1 ≤ k < n), the minimum number of bridges after adding k edges, while maintaining the subtree bridge property. Given the root has only one child, the tree
 is essentially a 'caterpillar' (a main chain with possible branches). We will use BFS/DFS to compute the tree's depth structure and subtree sizes, and then use a greedy or dynamic progra
mming approach to optimally add edges to minimize bridges. For input/output, we will use sys.stdin and sys.stdout for speed. No external libraries are needed beyond Python's standard libr
ary, as the problem is algorithmic and requires custom logic. The code will be well-commented and modular, with clear separation between input parsing, core logic, and output formatting."
