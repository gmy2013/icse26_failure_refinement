(mmetagpt)  "A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by in
serting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example: * bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" an
d "((1+1)+1)"); * bracket sequences ")(", "(" and ")" are not. Let's define the inverse of the bracket sequence as follows: replace all brackets '(' with ')', and vice versa (all brackets
 ')' with '('). For example, strings "()((" and ")())" are inverses of each other. You are given a regular bracket sequence $s$. Calculate the number of pairs of integers $(l,r)$ ($1 \le
l \le r \le |s|$) such that if you replace the substring of $s$ from the $l$-th character to the $r$-th character (inclusive) with its inverse, $s$ will still be a regular bracket sequenc
e. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty regular bracket sequence; it consist

 case, print a single integer — the number of pairs $(l,r)$ meeting the conditions from the statement."

    "Implementation approach": "We will design an efficient solution using prefix sums to represent the balance of brackets at each position. For each test case, we will precompute the pr
efix sum array (where '(' increases the sum by 1 and ')' decreases it by 1). To efficiently check if inverting a substring s[l..r] keeps the sequence regular, we observe that inverting a
substring flips the sign of the balance changes within that range. We need to ensure that after inversion, the prefix sums never go negative and the final balance is zero. We will use seg
ment trees or precomputed min/max prefix/suffix arrays to quickly check the validity of each possible (l, r) pair. However, since the input size is large, we will optimize further by obse
rving that only substrings with equal numbers of '(' and ')' (i.e., even length and balance zero) are candidates, and we can use a hashmap to count valid pairs based on prefix sum values.

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses prefix sums, precomputes min/max prefix/suffix arrays, and uses hashmaps to efficiently count valid pairs. The class and m
ethod structure matches the design.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. The algorithm efficiently checks all valid (l, r) pairs for substring inversion, ensuring the sequence remains regular. The checks for even length, pref
ix/suffix validity, and balance are all present.
3. Yes, the code follows the described data structures and interfaces. The `BracketSequenceSolver` class encapsulates the logic, and the `Main` class handles input/output as specified.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented as required. There are no missing implementations.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies are imported. No third-party libraries are required, and only standard library modules are used.
6. Yes, methods from other files are not needed, as all logic is self-contained in this file.

## Code Review Result
