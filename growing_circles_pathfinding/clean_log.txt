The key insight is that the user\'s position at time t is a linear interpolation between start and goal, and the radius of each circle at time t is t. For each circle, we need to check if at any time t in [0, D] (where D is the Euclidean distance from start to goal) the user\'s position is exactly at distance t from the circle center (i.e., touches the circumference). This reduces to checking if the minimum distance from the path segment to the circle center is less than or equal to the corresponding time (radius).

The key insight is that the user\'s position at time t is a linear interpolation between start and goal, and the radius of each circle at time t is t. For each circle, we need to check if at any time t in [0, D] (where D is the Euclidean distance from start to goal) the user\'s position is exactly at distance t from the circle center (i.e., touches the circumference). This reduces to checking if the minimum distance from the path segment to the circle center is less than or equal to the corresponding time (radius).
