s to minimize the number of steps required, considering the movement and coloring rules for the two chess pieces. Since the tree can be large (up to 2*10^5 nodes in total), we avoid expli
cit simulation and instead compute the minimum number of steps analytically. The key insight is that the process is dominated by the time it takes for P_A to reach the farthest node (to p
aint it red), and for P_B to follow and turn red nodes blue. We will use BFS to compute the maximum distance from the starting positions and derive the answer. For input/output, we use fa
