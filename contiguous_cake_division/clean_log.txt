Given the values of each piece of the cake for each person, you need to give each person a contiguous slice of cake. In other words, the indices at the left and right ends of these subarrays (the slices given to each person) can be represented as $(l_a, r_a)$, $(l_b, r_b)$ and $(l_c, r_c)$ respectively for Alice, Bob and Charlie. The division needs to satisfy the following constraints: * No piece is assigned to more than one person, i.e., no two subarrays among $[l_a,\\ldots,r_a]$, $[l_b, \\ldots, r_b]$ and $[l_c, \\ldots, r_c]$ intersect. * $ \\sum_{i = l_a}^{r_a} a_i, \\sum_{i = l_b}^{r_b} b_i, \\sum_{i = l_c}^{r_c} c_i \\geq \\lceil \\frac{tot}{3} \\rceil$. Here, the notation $\\lceil \\frac{a}{b} \\rceil$ represents ceiling division. It is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to the exact division of $a$ by $b$. In other words, it rounds up the division result to the nearest integer. For instance $\\lceil \\frac{10}{3} \\rceil = 4$ and $\\lceil \\frac{15}{3} \\rceil = 5$.

The following three lines contain $n$ integers each: One line with $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ represents the values for Alice ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$). The next line with $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ represents the values for Bob ($1 \\le b_i \\le 10^6$). The next line with $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ represents the values for Charlie ($1 \\le c_i \\le 10^6$).
