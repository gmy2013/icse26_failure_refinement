The main challenge is to determine, for each test case, whether there exists a set of integer bets x_1, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 10^9) such that for every i, k_i * x_i > sum(x_j for all j). If all k_i = 2, it is impossible, as the sum of bets will always be at least half the payout for any outcome. Otherwise, we can construct a solution by setting all bets to 1 except for the outcome with the largest multiplier, which we set to a value that ensures the inequality holds for all outcomes. The program will read input efficiently, process all test cases, and output either a valid bet distribution or -1 for each case.
