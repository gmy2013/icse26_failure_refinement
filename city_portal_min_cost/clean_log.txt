The cities are numbered from $1$ to $n$. Portals are used to move between cities. There are $4$ colors of portals: blue, green, red, and yellow. Each city has portals of two different colors. You can move from city $i$ to city $j$ if they have portals of the same color (for example, you can move between a blue-red city and a blue- green city). This movement costs $|i-j|$ coins. Your task is to answer $q$ independent queries: calculate the minimum cost to move from city $x$ to city $y$. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\\\\\\\le t \\\\\\\\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\\\\\\\le n, q \\\\\\\\le 2 \\\\\\\\cdot 10^5$) — the number of cities and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains $n$ strings of the following types: BG, BR, BY, GR, GY, or RY; the $i$-th of them describes the portals located in the $i$-th city; the symbol B indicates that there is a blue portal in the city, G — green, R — red, and Y — yellow. The $j$-th of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $x_j$ and $y_j$ ($1 \\\\\\\\le x_j, y_j \\\\\\\\le n$) — the description of the $j$-th query.

For each query, to find the minimum cost from city x to city y, we check if they share a color directly (immediate move), or if not, for each color in city x, we use binary search (via bisect from Python\'s standard library) to find the closest city with the same color as city y, minimizing |i-j|. This approach ensures O(log n) query time after O(n) preprocessing per test case. We avoid graph traversal per query, which would be too slow. The solution is implemented in pure Python, using only the standard library (bisect). No external dependencies are required, ensuring simplicity and performance.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class CityPortalSystem {\\n        -n: int\\n        -city_portals: list[str]\\n        -color_to_indices: dict[str, list[int]]\\n        +__init__(n: int, city_portals: list[str])\\n        +min_cost(x: int, y: int) int\\n    }\\n    class QueryProcessor {\\n        -systems: list[CityPortalSystem]\\n        +__init__()\\n        +add_test_case(n: int, city_portals: list[str], queries: list[tuple[int, int]])\\n        +process_all() list[list[int]]\\n    }\\n    Main --> QueryProcessor\\n    QueryProcessor --> CityPortalSystem\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Main as main.py\\n    participant QP as QueryProcessor\\n    participant CPS as CityPortalSystem\\n    Main->>QP: __init__()\\n    loop For each test case\\n        Main->>QP: add_test_case(n, city_portals, queries)\\n        QP->>CPS: __init__(n, city_portals)\\n    end\\n    Main->>QP: process_all()\\n    QP->>CPS: min_cost(x, y) (for each query)\\n    CPS-->>QP: return cost\\n    QP-->>Main: return all results\\n    Main-->>User: print results\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"It is not specified if cities can be revisited or if only direct connections are allowed.
