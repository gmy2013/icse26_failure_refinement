    "Implementation approach": "We will design a high-performance, memory-efficient solution that avoids representing the entire grid in memory. Instead, we will track chip positions usin
g sets and dictionaries, and maintain the current grid boundaries as four integers. For each move, we will efficiently determine which chips are in the cut area using sorted lists and bin
ary search (via the bisect module from Python's standard library). We will alternate turns between Alice and Bob, updating their scores as chips are collected. Input and output will be ha
ndled in batch mode for efficiency, using sys.stdin and sys.stdout. No external open-source libraries are required beyond the Python standard library, as bisect and collections are suffic
ient for our needs. The code will be modular, with a Game class encapsulating the logic for a single test case, and a main.py script handling input/output and test case management.",

## Code Review: game.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It encapsulates the game logic in a `Game` class, uses efficient data structures, and provides a `process_moves` method as specifi
ed.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. The chip removal, score calculation, and grid boundary updates are handled as described in the requirements.
3. Yes, the code follows the specified data structures and interfaces, including the use of sets, dictionaries, and sorted lists for efficient lookup and updates.
4. Yes, all required functions are implemented (`__init__`, `process_moves`, `_cut_rows`, `_cut_cols`).
5. Yes, all necessary standard library dependencies (`bisect`, `collections.defaultdict`, `typing`) are imported.
6. Yes, the code is self-contained and does not require methods from other files for its logic.

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It reads input in batch mode, processes each test case, instantiates the Game class, and outputs the results.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. It robustly handles blank lines, splits and parses input as required, and manages the test case loop properly.
3. Yes, the code follows the specified "Data structures and interfaces". The Main class is used as described, and it interacts with the Game class as per the design.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The main() method is present and performs all required steps.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The code imports sys, List, Tuple, and Game from game.py.
6. Yes, methods from other files (specifically, Game from game.py) are being reused correctly.
