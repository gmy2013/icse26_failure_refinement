The main challenge is efficiently enumerating all integer triplets (a, b, c) such that a * b * c = k, with 1 <= a <= x, 1 <= b <= y, 1 <= c <= z, and maximizing the placement count. We will use efficient divisor enumeration and factorization, leveraging Python\'s arbitrary-precision integers. For each test case, we will generate all divisors of k up to x, and for each, check if the remaining product can be split into two divisors within the bounds of y and z. We will use itertools for permutations to ensure all valid (a, b, c) orderings are considered. No external libraries are required beyond the Python standard library. The command-line interface will be minimal and robust, with clear input prompts and error handling.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class BoxPlacementSolver {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +max_placements(x: int, y: int, z: int, k: int) int\\n        +_divisor_triplets(k: int, x: int, y: int, z: int) list[tuple[int, int, int]]\\n    }\\n    class MainApp {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +run() None\\n    }\\n    MainApp --> BoxPlacementSolver : uses\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as MainApp\\n    participant S as BoxPlacementSolver\\n    M->>S: __init__()\\n    M->>M: Read t (number of test cases)\\n    loop For each test case\\n        M->>M: Read x, y, z, k\\n        M->>S: max_placements(x, y, z, k)\\n        S->>S: _divisor_triplets(k, x, y, z)\\n        S-->>S: Generate all valid (a, b, c) triplets\\n        S-->>M: Return max placements\\n        M->>M: Print result\\n    end\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The only ambiguity is whether permutations of (a, b, c) that are numerically equal (e.g., (2,2,3) and (2,3,2)) should be considered distinct placements if the box is not rotated.
