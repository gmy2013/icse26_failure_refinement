The core challenge is to efficiently arrange gorillas to maximize the sum of heights in all k x k sub-squares. The optimal approach is to place the tallest gorillas in the cells that are included in the most k x k sub-squares. We will precompute, for each cell, how many k x k sub-squares it belongs to, sort these weights, and assign the tallest gorillas to the highest-weighted cells. This greedy approach is both optimal and efficient. We will use only standard Python libraries (collections, heapq, etc.) for performance and simplicity. The UI will be a simple CLI, as per requirements.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class GorillaPhotoshootSpectacle {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +process_test_cases(test_cases: list) -> list[int]\\n        +max_spectacle(n: int, m: int, k: int, gorilla_heights: list[int]) -> int\\n        +_cell_weights(n: int, m: int, k: int) -> list[int]\\n    }\\n    class CLI {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +read_input() -> list[dict]\\n        +display_results(results: list[int])\\n        +run()\\n    }\\n    CLI --> GorillaPhotoshootSpectacle\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant CLI as CLI\\n    participant GPS as GorillaPhotoshootSpectacle\\n    CLI->>CLI: read_input()\\n    CLI-->>CLI: test_cases\\n    CLI->>GPS: process_test_cases(test_cases)\\n    GPS->>GPS: max_spectacle(n, m, k, gorilla_heights) for each test case\\n    GPS->>GPS: _cell_weights(n, m, k)\\n    GPS-->>CLI: results\\n    CLI->>CLI: display_results(results)\\n    CLI-->>User: Output spectacle values\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The requirements do not specify if the actual arrangement (grid layout) needs to be output or visualized, or just the maximum spectacle value.
