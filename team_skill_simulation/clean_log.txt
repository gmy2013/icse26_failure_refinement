uickly compute the maximum possible team skill if that candidate is excluded, given the greedy assignment rules. To achieve this, we will precompute the best assignment for the full set,
then for each exclusion, efficiently recalculate the assignment using sorted lists and prefix sums. We will use the 'bisect' module from Python's standard library for efficient insertion
and removal in sorted lists. No heavy external dependencies are needed, as the problem is algorithmic and can be solved with built-in data structures. The code will be modular, with clear
 separation between input parsing, simulation logic, and output formatting. The solution will be scalable and suitable for competitive programming environments.",

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It follows the described system design, modularizes the logic into classes, and separates input parsing, simulation, and output fo
rmatting.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. The exclusion and assignment logic is implemented efficiently, and the assignment is recalculated for each exclusion as required.
3. Yes, the code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" described in the system design. The Candidate, TeamSkillSimulator, InputParser, and OutputFormatter classes are all present a
nd used as specified.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented. There are no missing implementations.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies (bisect, typing) are imported. No third-party dependencies are required.
6. Yes, methods from other files are not needed, as all logic is self-contained in main.py.
