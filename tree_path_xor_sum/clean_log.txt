    "Implementation approach": "We will use Python and focus on efficient tree path queries using binary lifting for Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) computation, and precompute auxiliary arrays for fast path sum calculation. The main challenge is to compute the sum of (a_{p_i} XOR i) along the path from x to y, where i is the index along the path. Since the path index is not directly related to the node's depth, we need to reconstruct the path and process the sum efficiently. We will use standard libraries (collections, sys) for fast input and tree representation. For LCA, we will implement binary lifting from scratch (as open-source libraries for this in Python are rare and not always efficient for competitive programming). The code will be modular, with clear separation between input parsing, tree preprocessing, and query answering. The design will allow for easy extension and maintenance.",
