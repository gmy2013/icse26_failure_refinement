The main challenge is to answer, for each query, the maximum distance Chefir can reach from a given node with a stamina constraint, where moving to a non-descendant costs stamina. To achieve this, we will preprocess the tree using BFS/DFS to compute depths, parent/ancestor tables (using Binary Lifting for O(log n) ancestor checks), and the farthest node in each subtree. For each query, we will use these precomputed structures to efficiently determine the farthest reachable node, considering stamina and ancestor relationships. We will use only standard Python libraries (collections, bisect, etc.) for performance and compatibility. The command-line interface will accept input in a competitive programming style, and output only the required distances per query.

The main challenge is to answer, for each query, the maximum distance Chefir can reach from a given node with a stamina constraint, where moving to a non-descendant costs stamina. To achieve this, we will preprocess the tree using BFS/DFS to compute depths, parent/ancestor tables (using Binary Lifting for O(log n) ancestor checks), and the farthest node in each subtree. For each query, we will use these precomputed structures to efficiently determine the farthest reachable node, considering stamina and ancestor relationships. We will use only standard Python libraries (collections, bisect, etc.) for performance and compatibility. The command-line interface will accept input in a competitive programming style, and output only the required distances per query.
