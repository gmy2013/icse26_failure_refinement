You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English.

The key insight is that for each node, the maximum number of operations is limited by the minimum value among its children, as we cannot make any child negative. We will process the tree bottom-up, at each node collecting the sum of values that can be pushed up to the parent, ensuring all node values remain non-negative. The solution will be modular, with clear separation between input parsing, tree construction, and the core algorithm. For input/output, we will use sys.stdin and sys.stdout for speed, and collections.defaultdict for tree representation. No external libraries are required beyond Python\'s standard library, as performance is critical and the problem is algorithmic.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class TreeRootMaximizer {\\n        +__init__(self, n: int, a: list[int], parents: list[int])\\n        +maximize_root(self) int\\n        -_dfs(self, node: int) tuple[int, int]\\n    }\\n    class InputHandler {\\n        +read_input(self) list[tuple[int, list[int], list[int]]]\\n    }\\n    class OutputHandler {\\n        +write_output(self, results: list[int])\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main(self)\\n    }\\n    Main --> InputHandler\\n    Main --> TreeRootMaximizer\\n    Main --> OutputHandler\\n    TreeRootMaximizer <..> InputHandler : uses data\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant IH as InputHandler\\n    participant TRM as TreeRootMaximizer\\n    participant OH as OutputHandler\\n    M->>IH: read_input()\\n    IH-->>M: test_cases\\n    loop for each test_case\\n        M->>TRM: __init__(n, a, parents)\\n        M->>TRM: maximize_root()\\n        TRM-->>M: result\\n    end\\n    M->>OH: write_output(results)\\n    OH-->>M: (done)\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The requirements are clear.
