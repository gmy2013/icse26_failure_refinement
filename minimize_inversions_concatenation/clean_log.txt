Note that you do not need to count the actual number of inversions.More formally, you need to choose a permutation$^{\\\\ddagger}$ $p$ of length $n$, so that the array $b = [a_{p_1,1}, a_{p_1,2}, a_{p_2, 1}, a_{p_2, 2}, \\\\ldots, a_{p_n,1}, a_{p_n,2}]$ contains as few inversions as possible.$^{\\\\dagger}$The number of inversions in an array $c$ is the number of pairs of indices $i$ and $j$ such that $i < j$ and $c_i > c_j$.$^{\\\\ddagger}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).

Based on competitive programming heuristics and analysis, sorting the arrays by their first element (and then by the second element as a tiebreaker) is a strong greedy approach that minimizes inversions in most cases. This is because placing arrays with smaller starting elements earlier reduces the chance of larger elements appearing before smaller ones, which would create inversions. We will use Python\'s built-in sorting (Timsort, O(n log n)) for efficiency. The solution will support multiple test cases and large input sizes by reading input efficiently (using sys.stdin). The output will be a single line per test case with the concatenated array. No external libraries are required beyond the Python standard library, ensuring simplicity and ease of integration.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class ArrayPair {\\n        +int first\\n        +int second\\n        +int index\\n        +__init__(self, first: int, second: int, index: int)\\n    }\\n    class InversionMinimizer {\\n        +minimize_inversions(self, pairs: list[ArrayPair]) -> list[int]\\n    }\\n    class TestCaseHandler {\\n        +read_input(self) -> list[list[ArrayPair]]\\n        +process_test_cases(self, test_cases: list[list[ArrayPair]]) -> list[list[int]]\\n        +output_results(self, results: list[list[int]])\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main(self)\\n    }\\n    Main --> TestCaseHandler\\n    TestCaseHandler --> InversionMinimizer\\n    InversionMinimizer <..

The problem is a variant of dynamic programming (DP) on a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node (problem) can lead to different next nodes based on the action (submit/skip). To handle large input sizes, we avoid recursion and use iterative DP with precomputed transitions. We use numpy for fast array operations and sys.stdin for fast input. No heavy frameworks are needed; the solution is self-contained and leverages Python\'s built-in and numpy\'s efficient data structures. The code is modular, with a clear separation between input parsing, DP computation, and output. The design is extensible for future rule changes.","File list":["main.py","olympiad_solver.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class OlympiadSolver {\\n        +solve(test_cases: list[dict]) -> list[int]\\n        -_compute_max_score(n: int, a: list[int], b: list[int]) -> int\\n    }\\n    class InputParser {\\n        +parse_input() -> list[dict]\\n    }\\n    class OutputFormatter {\\n        +format_output(results: list[int]) -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> OlympiadSolver\\n    Main --> InputParser\\n    Main --> OutputFormatter\\n    \\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant IP as InputParser\\n    participant OS as OlympiadSolver\\n    participant OF as OutputFormatter\\n    M->>IP: parse_input()\\n    IP-->>M: test_cases\\n    M->>OS: solve(test_cases)\\n    OS-->>M: results\\n    M->>OF: format_output(results)\\n    OF-->>M: (prints output)\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The optimal DP transition logic is complex and may need further clarification, especially regarding edge cases for problem selection after skip/submit.

For each vertex, its type is known to you.You need to determine whether it is possible to draw exactly $n$ directed edges between the source graphs such that the following four conditions are met:  * The ends of any added edge lie in different graphs.    * From each outgoing vertex, exactly one added edge originates.    * Into each incoming vertex, exactly one added edge enters.    * In the resulting graph, the length of any cycle is divisible by $k$. $^{\\dagger}$A strongly connected graph is a graph in which there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex. Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in each graph and the value by which the length of each cycle is divisible.The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($a_i \\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}$). If $a_i = 0$, then vertex $i$ of the first graph is incoming.

The $i$-th of them contains two integers $v_i$ and $u_i$ ($1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$) — an edge in the first graph leading from vertex $v_i$ to vertex $u_i$.Next, in the same format, follows the description of the second graph.The next line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($b_i \\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}$).

The $i$-th of them contains two integers $v_i$ and $u_i$ ($1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$) — an edge in the second graph leading from vertex $v_i$ to vertex $u_i$.It is guaranteed that both graphs are strongly connected, and the lengths of all cycles are divisible by $k$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $m_1$ and the sum of $m_2$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.
