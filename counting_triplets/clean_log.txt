The triplet counting logic matches the requirements and constraints, and input/output handling is robust.\n3. Yes, the code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as specified in the system design, with each class and method matching the described API.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented as required.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The only required package is `typing`, which is imported.\n6. No, methods from other files are not being reused. The `TripletCounter` class is redefined in this file instead of being imported from `triplet_counter.py`. To fix this, remove the local definition of `TripletCounter` and import it from `triplet_counter.py`:\n   - Replace the local `TripletCounter` class with `from triplet_counter import TripletCounter`.\n\n## Actions\n1.

The main challenge is to count the number of ordered triplets (a, b, c) of positive integers such that ab + ac + bc <= n and a + b + c <= x, for multiple test cases. Given the constraints (sum of n and x over all test cases <= 1e6), we can use nested loops for a and b, and for each (a, b), compute the valid range for c using mathematical bounds. No external open-source libraries are required for the core logic, but we will use standard Python libraries for input/output and typing. The interface will be a simple command-line tool (main.py) that reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.
