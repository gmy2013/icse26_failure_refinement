The main challenge is to process up to 300,000 queries in real-time, each potentially changing the optimal artifact distribution. To achieve this, we will use the \'sortedcontainers\' library (SortedList) for fast insertions, deletions, and range queries on hero health and artifact durability. For each query, we will maintain sorted lists of heroes and artifacts, and use binary search to optimally pair the strongest heroes with the most durable artifacts. The core logic will use binary search to determine the maximum number of rounds survivable after each update, simulating the battle with floating-point precision. The command-line interface will be minimalistic, showing the current army composition and survivable rounds after each query. No external dependencies except \'sortedcontainers\' are required, ensuring simplicity and performance.","File list":["main.py","battle.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class BattleSimulator {\\n        -heroes: SortedList\\n        -artifacts: SortedList\\n        +__init__()\\n        +add_hero(health: int) -> None\\n        +add_artifact(durability: int) -> None\\n        +max_survivable_rounds() -> int\\n        +_simulate(rounds: int) -> bool\\n        +get_army_state() -> dict\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        -simulator: BattleSimulator\\n        +__init__()\\n        +run() -> None\\n        +_parse_query(query: str) -> tuple\\n        +_display_state(state: dict) -> None\\n    }\\n    BattleSimulator <..
