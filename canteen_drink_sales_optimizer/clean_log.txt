His friend will sell drinks for $n$ days, numbered from day $1$ to day $n$. There are also $m$ types of drinks, numbered from $1$ to $m$.The profit gained from selling a drink on a particular day can vary. On day $i$, the projected profit from selling drink of type $j$ is $A_{i, j}$. Note that $A_{i, j}$ can be negative, meaning that selling the drink would actually incur a loss.Pak Chanek wants to help his friend plan the sales over the $n$ days. On day $i$, Pak Chanek must choose to sell at least one type of drink. Furthermore, the types of drinks sold on a single day must form a subarray. In other words, in each day, Pak Chanek will select $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq m$. Then all types of drinks between $i$ and $j$ (inclusive) will be sold.However, to ensure that customers from the previous day keep returning, the selection of drink types sold on day $i$ ($i>1$) must meet the following conditions:  * At least one drink type sold on day $i$ must also have been sold on day $i-1$.    * At least one drink type sold on day $i$ must not have been sold on day $i-1$. The daily profit is the sum of the profits from all drink types sold on that day. The total profit from the sales plan is the sum of the profits over $n$ days. What is the maximum total profit that can be achieved if Pak Chanek plans the sales optimally? Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$; $3 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$; $n \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$) — the number of rows and columns in a grid.The next $n$ lines of each test case contain $m$ integers each, where the $i$-th line contains the integers $A_{i,1} A_{i,2}, \\\\ldots, A_{i,m}$ ($-10^9 \\\\leq A_{i,j} \\\\leq 10^9$) — project profits of each drink type on the $i$-th day.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n \\\\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^5$.

DrinkSalesOptimizer contains the core DP algorithm and uses numpy for efficient array operations. InputParser and OutputFormatter are utility classes for input/output handling. No external configuration or shared utility files are required.","Anything UNCLEAR":"It is assumed that only the maximum profit per test case is required as output, not the actual sequence of drink selections. If the sequence is needed, the data structures and output format will need to be extended."}\n\n## Code Files\n\n\n\n## Code to be Reviewed: main.py\n```Code\n## main.py\n\nimport sys\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass InputParser:\n    """Parses input from stdin for the canteen drink sales optimization problem."""\n\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def parse_input(self) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[List[int]]]]:\n        """\n        Parses the input from stdin.\n\n        Returns:\n            List[Tuple[int, int, List[List[int]]]]: A list of test cases, each as (n, m, grid).\n        """\n        input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        idx = 0\n        t = int(input_lines[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n, m = map(int, input_lines[idx].split())\n            idx += 1\n            grid = []\n            for _ in range(n):\n                row = list(map(int, input_lines[idx].split()))\n                idx += 1\n                grid.append(row)\n            test_cases.append((n, m, grid))\n        return test_cases\n\n\nclass DrinkSalesOptimizer:\n    """\n    Optimizes the canteen drink sales for maximum profit using dynamic programming.\n    """\n\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def maximize_profit(self, test_cases: List[Tuple[int, int, List[List[int]]]]) -> List[int]:\n        """\n        For each test case, computes the maximum profit.\n\n        Args:\n            test_cases (List[Tuple[int, int, List[List[int]]]]): List of test cases.\n\n        Returns:\n            List[int]: List of maximum profits for each test case.\n        """\n        results = []\n        for n, m, grid in test_cases:\n            result = self._max_profit_single_case(n, m, grid)\n            results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n    def _max_profit_single_case(self, n: int, m: int, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        """\n        Computes the maximum profit for a single test case.\n\n        Args:\n            n (int): Number of days.\n            m (int): Number of drink types.\n            grid (List[List[int]]): Profit grid.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: Maximum profit.\n        """\n        # Precompute all subarray sums for each row\n        subarray_sums_per_row = []\n        for row in grid:\n            subarray_sums = self._get_subarray_sums(row)\n            subarray_sums_per_row.append(subarray_sums)\n\n        # DP: For each day, for each subarray (l, r), store the best profit ending at (l, r)\n        # State: dp_prev[(l, r)] = max profit up to previous day, ending with subarray (l, r)\n        dp_prev = dict()\n        # Initialize for day 0\n        for l, r, s in subarray_sums_per_row[0]:\n            dp_prev[(l, r)] = s\n\n        for day in range(1, n):\n            subarrays = subarray_sums_per_row[day]\n            # For fast lookup, build for previous day:\n            # For each possible (l, r), store the best profit\n            # To efficiently find overlapping subarrays, for each possible length, build prefix max arrays\n            # But since m is up to 2e5/n, we can process all pairs\n\n            # For each subarray in current day, find the best overlapping subarray from previous day\n            # Overlap: [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] overlap if not disjoint and not identical\n            # i.e., max(l1, l2) <= min(r1, r2) and (l1 != l2 or r1 != r2)\n\n            # For fast lookup, for each possible (l, r), store all previous subarrays that overlap\n            # Since m is not too large, we can process all pairs\n\n            # Build for previous day: for each possible (l, r), store in a list by length\n            prev_by_length = defaultdict(list)\n            for (l1, r1), profit in dp_prev.items():\n                prev_by_length[r1 -
