e the string s so that the lexicographically maximum substring (the 'core') is minimized. After analysis, the optimal strategy is to sort the string in non-increasing (reverse) order, so
the largest character is at the front, making the core as small as possible. However, to minimize the core, we need to ensure that the largest character appears as late as possible in the
 rearranged string. The minimum possible core is achieved by sorting the string in increasing order (i.e., lex smallest arrangement), so the last character (the largest) is as late as pos
sible, and the core is the suffix starting at the first occurrence of the largest character. Thus, for each test case, we sort s, find the largest character, and output the substring from
 its first occurrence to the end. We will use only Python's built-in libraries for maximum compatibility and speed, and batch input/output for efficiency.",

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It defines the `LexMinCoreSolver` and `MainApp` classes, processes batch input, and outputs the correct result for each test case.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. The minimal core is computed as the suffix of the sorted string starting from the first occurrence of the largest character, as required.
3. Yes, the code follows the specified data structures and interfaces. The class and method signatures match the design.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented as described in the requirements and design.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies are imported. Only built-in modules are used, as required.
6. Yes, there is no cross-file method reuse, as all logic is contained in a single file.

## Actions
