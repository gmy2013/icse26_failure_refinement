(mmetagpt)  "Elections are taking place in Berland. There are $n$ candidates participating in the elections, numbered from $1$ t

 not allow candidate number $i$ to participate in the elections, all $a_i$ of his fans will become undecided, and will vote for the candidate with the lowest number. You are curious to fi
nd, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, the minimum number of candidates that need to be excluded from the elections for candidate number $i$ to win the elections. Each test consists of multipl

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses only the standard library, is single-file, and follows the described modular structure with InputParser, ElectionSimulator
, and OutputFormatter classes. The main logic for determining the minimum number of exclusions is implemented as specified.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. The binary search in `_min_exclusions_for_candidate` efficiently determines the minimum number of higher-vote candidates to exclude for each candidate t
o win, considering redistribution of votes. Edge cases (e.g., already winning, all zero votes) are handled.
3. Yes, the code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as described in the system design. The classes and their methods match the provided class diagram and call flow.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented as required. There are no missing implementations.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies (`sys`, `bisect`, `typing`) are imported. No third-party libraries are used, as required.
6. Yes, methods from other classes are used correctly within the same file.
