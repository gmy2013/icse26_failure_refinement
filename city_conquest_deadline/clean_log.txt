You win if, for each $i$, you conquer city $i$ at a time no later than $a_i$. A winning strategy may or may not exist, also depending on the starting city. How many starting cities allow you to win? Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$) — the number of cities.The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$) — the deadlines for conquering the cities.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^5$. For each test case, output a single integer: the number of starting cities that allow you to win.","Project Name":"city_conquest_deadline","Product Goals":["Efficiently determine the number of valid starting cities for each test case","Ensure the solution handles large input sizes within time constraints","Provide clear and user-friendly output for each test case"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to input multiple test cases with city deadlines and get the number of valid starting cities for each.","As a user, I want the program to process large datasets quickly without errors.","As a user, I want the output to be easy to interpret and match the problem requirements."],"Competitive Analysis":["Codeforces problem solutions: Often efficient but may lack user-friendly interfaces.","AtCoder contest solutions: Focus on performance, less on usability.","LeetCode contest problems: Good explanations, but sometimes limited to single test cases.","HackerRank challenge solutions: User-friendly, but may not handle very large inputs efficiently.","GeeksforGeeks editorial: Detailed, but not always optimized for competitive constraints.","CP-Algorithms: Excellent for theory, but not always for practical implementation.","Competitive companion browser extension: Good for parsing, but not for solving."],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\\n    title \\"Competitive Programming Solutions\\"\\n    x-axis \\"Low Performance\\" --> \\"High Performance\\"\\n    y-axis \\"Low Usability\\" --> \\"High Usability\\"\\n    quadrant-1 \\"Ideal\\"\\n    quadrant-2 \\"Needs Optimization\\"\\n    quadrant-3 \\"Rework Needed\\"\\n    quadrant-4 \\"Usable but Slow\\"\\n    \\"Codeforces\\": [0.9, 0.5]\\n    \\"AtCoder\\": [0.95, 0.4]\\n    \\"LeetCode\\": [0.7, 0.7]\\n    \\"HackerRank\\": [0.6, 0.8]\\n    \\"GeeksforGeeks\\": [0.5, 0.6]\\n    \\"CP-Algorithms\\": [0.8, 0.3]\\n    \\"Our Target Product\\": [0.95, 0.85]","Requirement Analysis":"The requirement is to process multiple test cases, each with a list of cities and their respective deadlines for conquest. For each test case, the program must determine how many starting cities allow a winning strategy, i.e., conquering all cities within their deadlines. The main challenge is to efficiently check, for each possible starting city, whether it is possible to conquer all cities in time, given the adjacency constraint and the deadlines. The solution must be optimized for large input sizes, as the sum of n over all test cases can be up to 2*10^5.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Efficiently process multiple test cases with large n."],["P0","For each test case, determine the number of valid starting cities that allow a win."],["P1","Ensure the solution runs within time limits for maximum constraints."],["P1","Provide clear and concise output for each test case."],["P2","Add input validation and error handling for edge cases."]],"UI Design draft":"A simple command-line interface where the user inputs the number of test cases, followed by the number of cities and their deadlines for each test case. The output is a single integer per test case, representing the number of valid starting cities. The UI is minimal, focusing on clarity and speed, with clear prompts and error messages for invalid input.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The original requirements do not specify if ties (conquering a city exactly at its deadline) are allowed, but the phrase \'no later than\' suggests they are. No details are given about the preferred input/output format (e.g., space-separated, line-separated), so standard competitive programming conventions will be assumed."}\n\n-----\n\n## format example\n[CONTENT]\n{\n    "Implementation approach": "We will ...",\n    "File list": [\n        "main.py",\n        "game.py"\n    ],\n    "Data structures and interfaces": "\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -SearchEngine search_engine\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class SearchEngine {\\n        -Index index\\n        -Ranking ranking\\n        -Summary summary\\n        +search(query: str) str\\n    }\\n    class Index {\\n        -KnowledgeBase knowledge_base\\n        +create_index(data: dict)\\n        +query_index(query: str) list\\n    }\\n    class Ranking {\\n        +rank_results(results: list) list\\n    }\\n    class Summary {\\n        +summarize_results(results: list) str\\n    }\\n    class KnowledgeBase {\\n        +update(data: dict)\\n        +fetch_data(query: str) dict\\n    }\\n    Main --> SearchEngine\\n    SearchEngine --> Index\\n    SearchEngine --> Ranking\\n    SearchEngine --> Summary\\n    Index --> KnowledgeBase\\n",\n    "Program call flow": "\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant SE as SearchEngine\\n    participant I as Index\\n    participant R as Ranking\\n    participant S as Summary\\n    participant KB as KnowledgeBase\\n    M->>SE: search(query)\\n    SE->>I: query_index(query)\\n    I->>KB: fetch_data(query)\\n    KB-->>I: return data\\n    I-->>SE: return results\\n    SE->>R: rank_results(results)\\n    R-->>SE: return ranked_results\\n    SE->>S: summarize_results(ranked_results)\\n    S-->>SE: return summary\\n    SE-->>M: return summary\\n",\n    "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on third-party API integration, ..."\n}\n[/CONTENT]\n\n## nodes: "<node>: <type>  # <instruction>"\n- Implementation approach: <class \'str\'>  # Analyze the difficult points of the requirements, select the appropriate open-source framework\n- File list: typing.List[str]  # Only need relative paths.
