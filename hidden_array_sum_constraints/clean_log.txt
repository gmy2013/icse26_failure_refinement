The core challenge is efficiently checking, for each possible replacement of \'?\', whether a valid a exists. We will use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant computation, leveraging the fact that the number of \'?\' is typically much less than n, and that prefix/suffix sum constraints can be represented as a system of equations/inequalities. For input validation and CLI, we will use Python\'s argparse and standard libraries. For combinatorial enumeration, we will use itertools. No heavy external dependencies are required, keeping the system simple and robust. The code will be modular, with clear separation between input handling, validation, core logic, and output.","File list":["main.py","hidden_array_solver.py","input_validator.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class HiddenArraySolver {\\n        +__init__(self, n: int, m: int, b: list[int], s: str)\\n        +count_valid_replacements(self) -> int\\n        -_enumerate_replacements(self, idx: int, current_s: list[str], memo: dict) -> int\\n        -_is_valid_assignment(self, s_variant: list[str]) -> bool\\n        -_check_feasibility(self, s_variant: list[str]) -> bool\\n    }\\n    class InputValidator {\\n        +__init__(self)\\n        +validate(self, n: int, m: int, b: list[int], s: str) -> None\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> HiddenArraySolver : uses\\n    Main --> InputValidator : uses\\n    HiddenArraySolver <..

Is the code implemented as per the requirements?  \n   - No. The code does not fully conform to the requirements and the provided system design. Specifically, the logic for checking prefix/suffix sum constraints is incorrect: it checks both prefix and suffix sums for every assignment, but the requirements and the interface suggest only one set of constraints (likely prefix or suffix, not both). Also, the allowed digits for \'?\' are not handled correctly: the code restricts replacements to digits 0-9, but the input validator allows any integer in [-m, m], which may include negative values if m > 9.\n\n2. Is the code logic completely correct?  \n   - No.  \n     - The `_check_feasibility` method checks both prefix and suffix sums, but the requirements and input only provide one list `b`, not two. This results in a double check that is not specified and will always fail unless `b` is symmetric.  \n     - The allowed digits for \'?\' are limited to 0-9, but if m > 9, valid replacements in [-m, m] (e.g., -10) are not considered.  \n     - The memoization dictionary is not used in the case where there are no \'?\', which is inconsistent with the rest of the code.\n\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?  \n   - Partially. The class and method names match the design, but the logic for allowed digits and constraint checking does not match the intended interface. The memoization is used, but not in all cases.\n\n4. Are all functions implemented?  \n   - Yes, all functions described in the class diagram are present, but `_enumerate_replacements` is not implemented as a separate method (its logic is in `count_valid_replacements`). This is acceptable for small codebases, but for extensibility and clarity, `_enumerate_replacements` should be a separate method.\n\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported?  \n   - Yes. The code imports `itertools` and typing modules as required.\n\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?  \n   - Not applicable in this file; input validation is assumed to be done before instantiating this class.\n\n## Actions\n1. Fix allowed digits for \'?\' to include all integers in [-m, m], not just 0-9.\n   ```python\n   # Replace this:\n   self.q_allowed_digits[idx] = [\n       d for d in range(0, 10) if -m <= d <= m\n   ]\n   # With this:\n   self.q_allowed_digits[idx] = list(range(-m, m + 1))\n   ```\n2. Clarify and fix the sum constraint checking:\n   - If `b` is prefix sums: check only prefix sums.\n   - If `b` is suffix sums: check only suffix sums.\n   - Document and implement only one, or allow a mode switch.\n   - For now, implement only prefix sum checking:\n   ```python\n   def _check_feasibility(self, s_variant: List[str]) -> bool:\n       a: List[int] = [int(ch) for ch in s_variant]\n       for idx, val in enumerate(a):\n           if val < -self.m or val > self.m:\n               return False\n       prefix_sum = 0\n       for i in range(self.n):\n           prefix_sum += a[i]\n           if prefix_sum != self.b[i]:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n3. Refactor enumeration logic into a separate `_enumerate_replacements` method for clarity and extensibility.\n4. Use memoization consistently, even when there are no \'?\'.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

The core challenge is efficiently checking, for each possible replacement of \'?\', whether a valid a exists. We will use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant computation, leveraging the fact that the number of \'?\' is typically much less than n, and that prefix/suffix sum constraints can be represented as a system of equations/inequalities. For input validation and CLI, we will use Python\'s argparse and standard libraries. For combinatorial enumeration, we will use itertools. No heavy external dependencies are required, keeping the system simple and robust. The code will be modular, with clear separation between input handling, validation, core logic, and output.","File list":["main.py","hidden_array_solver.py","input_validator.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class HiddenArraySolver {\\n        +__init__(self, n: int, m: int, b: list[int], s: str)\\n        +count_valid_replacements(self) -> int\\n        -_enumerate_replacements(self, idx: int, current_s: list[str], memo: dict) -> int\\n        -_is_valid_assignment(self, s_variant: list[str]) -> bool\\n        -_check_feasibility(self, s_variant: list[str]) -> bool\\n    }\\n    class InputValidator {\\n        +__init__(self)\\n        +validate(self, n: int, m: int, b: list[int], s: str) -> None\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> HiddenArraySolver : uses\\n    Main --> InputValidator : uses\\n    HiddenArraySolver <..

The core challenge is efficiently checking, for each possible replacement of \'?\', whether a valid a exists. We will use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant computation, leveraging the fact that the number of \'?\' is typically much less than n, and that prefix/suffix sum constraints can be represented as a system of equations/inequalities. For input validation and CLI, we will use Python\'s argparse and standard libraries. For combinatorial enumeration, we will use itertools. No heavy external dependencies are required, keeping the system simple and robust. The code will be modular, with clear separation between input handling, validation, core logic, and output.","File list":["main.py","hidden_array_solver.py","input_validator.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class HiddenArraySolver {\\n        +__init__(self, n: int, m: int, b: list[int], s: str)\\n        +count_valid_replacements(self) -> int\\n        -_enumerate_replacements(self, idx: int, current_s: list[str], memo: dict) -> int\\n        -_is_valid_assignment(self, s_variant: list[str]) -> bool\\n        -_check_feasibility(self, s_variant: list[str]) -> bool\\n    }\\n    class InputValidator {\\n        +__init__(self)\\n        +validate(self, n: int, m: int, b: list[int], s: str) -> None\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> HiddenArraySolver : uses\\n    Main --> InputValidator : uses\\n    HiddenArraySolver <..

The core challenge is efficiently checking, for each possible replacement of \'?\', whether a valid a exists. We will use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant computation, leveraging the fact that the number of \'?\' is typically much less than n, and that prefix/suffix sum constraints can be represented as a system of equations/inequalities. For input validation and CLI, we will use Python\'s argparse and standard libraries. For combinatorial enumeration, we will use itertools. No heavy external dependencies are required, keeping the system simple and robust. The code will be modular, with clear separation between input handling, validation, core logic, and output.","File list":["main.py","hidden_array_solver.py","input_validator.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class HiddenArraySolver {\\n        +__init__(self, n: int, m: int, b: list[int], s: str)\\n        +count_valid_replacements(self) -> int\\n        -_enumerate_replacements(self, idx: int, current_s: list[str], memo: dict) -> int\\n        -_is_valid_assignment(self, s_variant: list[str]) -> bool\\n        -_check_feasibility(self, s_variant: list[str]) -> bool\\n    }\\n    class InputValidator {\\n        +__init__(self)\\n        +validate(self, n: int, m: int, b: list[int], s: str) -> None\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> HiddenArraySolver : uses\\n    Main --> InputValidator : uses\\n    HiddenArraySolver <..
