The core challenge is to determine if, for each test case, the found array can be obtained from the original array by applying the given modification values in any order to any indices, possibly with redundant modifications. We will use collections.Counter to count the required modifications for each value and compare with the available modification values. No external frameworks are needed; only Python's standard library suffices for performance and simplicity. The solution will be optimized for O(n + m) per test case, using fast input/output (sys.stdin, sys.stdout).",

The core challenge is to determine if, for each test case, the found array can be obtained from the original array by applying the given modification values in any order to any indices, possibly with redundant modifications. We will use collections.Counter to count the required modifications for each value and compare with the available modification values. No external frameworks are needed; only Python\'s standard library suffices for performance and simplicity. The solution will be optimized for O(n + m) per test case, using fast input/output (sys.stdin, sys.stdout).","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class SofiaArrayVerifier {\\n        +verify_test_case(n: int, a: list[int], b: list[int], m: int, d: list[int]) bool\\n        +batch_verify(test_cases: list[dict]) list[str]\\n    }\\n    class CLI {\\n        +read_input() list[dict]\\n        +print_output(results: list[str])\\n        +main()\\n    }\\n    SofiaArrayVerifier <..
