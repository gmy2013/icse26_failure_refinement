Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.\n   ```python\n   def handle_events(self):\n       for event in pygame.event.get():\n           if event.type == pygame.QUI               return False\n           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOW               moved = False\n               if event.key == pygame.K_U                   moved = self.game.move(\'UP\')\n               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOW                   moved = self.game.move(\'DOWN\')\n               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEF                   moved = self.game.move(\'LEFT\')\n               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGH                   moved = self.game.move(\'RIGHT\')\n               if moved:\n                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful\n                   self.render()\n       return True\n   ```\n2.

If any answer is no, explain how to fix it step by step.\n1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported?
