The flipping process is equivalent to toggling bulbs at positions divisible by each i from 1 to n. After all operations, a bulb at position j is toggled for every divisor of j, so its final state depends on the parity of the number of divisors of j. A bulb remains ON if it is toggled an odd number of times, which happens only if j is a perfect square (since only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors). Therefore, after the process, the bulbs that remain ON are those at perfect square positions up to n. The number of bulbs ON is thus floor(sqrt(n)). To have exactly k bulbs ON, we need the smallest n such that floor(sqrt(n)) = k, i.e., n = k^2. Thus, for each k, the answer is n = k * k.
