The main challenge is to determine the minimum number of leaf-removal operations required so that all remaining leaves are at the same distance from the root. The optimal approach is to perform a BFS from the root to compute the depth of each node, identify all leaves, and then group leaves by their depth. The minimum number of operations is the total number of leaves minus the maximum number of leaves at any single depth (since we want all leaves to be at the same depth, we keep the largest group and remove the rest). For large input, we will use sys.stdin for fast input and collections like defaultdict and deque for efficient tree representation and traversal.
