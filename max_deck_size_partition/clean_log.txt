  metagpt.actions.write_prd:run:86 - New requirement detected: [DJ Genki vs Gram - Einherjar Joker](https://soundcloud.com/leon- hwang-368077289/einherjar-joker-dj-genki-vs-gram)⠀You have some cards. An integer between $1$ and $n$ is written on each card: specifically, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, you have $a_i$ cards which have the number $i$ written on them.There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have $k$ coins, so you can buy at most $k$ new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between $\mathbf{1}$ and $\mathbf{n}$, inclusive.After buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules:  * all the decks must have the same size;    * there are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck. Find the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally. Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \leq k \leq 10^{16}$) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq 10^{10}$, $\sum a_i \geq 1$) — the number of cards of type $i$ you have at the beginning, for each $1 \leq i \leq n$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible size of a deck if you operate optimally.

The core challenge is, for a given deck size d, to check if it\'s possible to partition all cards (including up to k purchased cards) into decks of size d, with no duplicate card values in any deck. For each d, we calculate how many complete decks can be formed from the current card counts, and how many extra cards (of each type) are needed to fill up to d decks. We sum the total number of cards needed and check if it is within k. This check is performed in O(n) per test case, and binary search over possible d (from 1 to sum(a_i) + k) ensures efficiency. We will use only Python\'s standard library for performance and simplicity, as no external libraries are required for this combinatorial optimization. The code will be modular, with clear separation between input parsing, core logic, and output formatting.","File list":["main.py","max_deck.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class MaxDeckSolver {\\n        +solve(test_cases: list[tuple[int, int, list[int]]]) -> list[int]\\n        -_max_deck_size(n: int, k: int, a: list[int]) -> int\\n        -_can_form_decks(d: int, n: int, k: int, a: list[int]) -> bool\\n    }\\n    class InputParser {\\n        +parse_input() -> list[tuple[int, int, list[int]]]\\n    }\\n    class OutputFormatter {\\n        +format_output(results: list[int]) -> None\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> InputParser : uses\\n    Main --> MaxDeckSolver : uses\\n    Main --> OutputFormatter : uses\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant IP as InputParser\\n    participant S as MaxDeckSolver\\n    participant OF as OutputFormatter\\n    M->>IP: parse_input()\\n    IP-->>M: test_cases\\n    M->>S: solve(test_cases)\\n    S-->>M: results\\n    M->>OF: format_output(results)\\n    OF-->>M: (prints output)\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The requirements are clear.

The core challenge is, for a given deck size d, to check if it\'s possible to partition all cards (including up to k purchased cards) into decks of size d, with no duplicate card values in any deck. For each d, we calculate how many complete decks can be formed from the current card counts, and how many extra cards (of each type) are needed to fill up to d decks. We sum the total number of cards needed and check if it is within k. This check is performed in O(n) per test case, and binary search over possible d (from 1 to sum(a_i) + k) ensures efficiency. We will use only Python\'s standard library for performance and simplicity, as no external libraries are required for this combinatorial optimization. The code will be modular, with clear separation between input parsing, core logic, and output formatting.","File list":["main.py","max_deck.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class MaxDeckSolver {\\n        +solve(test_cases: list[tuple[int, int, list[int]]]) -> list[int]\\n        -_max_deck_size(n: int, k: int, a: list[int]) -> int\\n        -_can_form_decks(d: int, n: int, k: int, a: list[int]) -> bool\\n    }\\n    class InputParser {\\n        +parse_input() -> list[tuple[int, int, list[int]]]\\n    }\\n    class OutputFormatter {\\n        +format_output(results: list[int]) -> None\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> InputParser : uses\\n    Main --> MaxDeckSolver : uses\\n    Main --> OutputFormatter : uses\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant IP as InputParser\\n    participant S as MaxDeckSolver\\n    participant OF as OutputFormatter\\n    M->>IP: parse_input()\\n    IP-->>M: test_cases\\n    M->>S: solve(test_cases)\\n    S-->>M: results\\n    M->>OF: format_output(results)\\n    OF-->>M: (prints output)\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The requirements are clear.
