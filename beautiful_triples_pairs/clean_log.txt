content)=2564
## Code Review: beautiful_triples.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It calculates the number of beautiful pairs of triples for each test case using the specified methods.
2. No, the code logic for generating triples (`_generate_triples`) is inefficient. It uses three nested loops, which result in O(n^3) complexity. This can be optimized using a sliding win
dow or hash-based technique as mentioned in the system design. Additionally, `_count_beautiful_pairs` can be optimized to avoid iterating over all triples unnecessarily.
3. Yes, the code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as described in the system design.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.
6. Yes, the methods are self-contained and do not rely on other files.

## Actions
1. Optimize `_generate_triples` to reduce computational complexity:
   ```python
   def _generate_triples(self, array: List[int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
       """
       Generates all possible triples from the given array using a sliding window approach.

       Args:
           array (List[int]): A list of integers.

       Returns:
           List[Tuple[int, int, int]]: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a triple (i, j, k).
       """
       n = len(array)
       triples = []
       for i in range(n - 2):
           for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
               k = j + (array[j] - array[i])  # Calculate k directly based on the condition
               if k < n and array[k] - array[j] == array[j] - array[i]:
                   triples.append((array[i], array[j], array[k]))
       return triples
   ```

2. Optimize `_count_beautiful_pairs` to avoid iterating over all triples:
   ```python
   def _count_beautiful_pairs(self, array: List[int]) -> int:
       """
       Counts the number of beautiful pairs directly without generating all triples.

       Args:
           array (List[int]): A list of integers.

       Returns:
           int: The count of beautiful pairs.
       """
       count = 0
       n = len(array)
       for i in range(n - 2):
           for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
               k = j + (array[j] - array[i])  # Calculate k directly based on the condition
               if k < n and array[k] - array[j] == array[j] - array[i]:
                   count += 1
       return count
   ```

3. Update `find_beautiful_pairs` to use the optimized `_count_beautiful_pairs`:
   ```python
   def find_beautiful_pairs(self) -> List[int]:
       """
       Finds the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

       Returns:
           List[int]: A list of integers representing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
       """
       results = []
       for _, array in self.test_cases:
           count = self._count_beautiful_pairs(array)
           results.append(count)

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Optimized `_count_beautiful_pairs`**:
   - Removed the need to generate all triples explicitly, reducing memory usage and computational complexity.
   - Directly calculated the third element (`k`) of the triple based on the condition `array[k] - array[j] == array[j] - array[i]`.

2. **Removed `_generate_triples`**:
   - Since `_count_beautiful_pairs` now directly calculates the count of beautiful pairs without generating triples, `_generate_triples` is no longer needed.

3. **Updated `find_beautiful_pairs`**:
   - Modified to use the optimized `_count_beautiful_pairs` method directly, simplifying the logic and improving efficiency.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: Reduced from O(n^3) to O(n^2) for each test case, as we now use two nested loops instead of three.
- **Space Complexity**: Reduced from O(n^3) (due to storing all triples) to O(1), as we no longer store intermediate triples.

This implementation is efficient, modular, and adheres to Google-style standards. It is also scalable for larger input sizes.

## Code Review: beautiful_triples.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It calculates the number of beautiful pairs of triples using a direct approach without generating all triples, which aligns with t
he stated implementation approach.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. The `_count_beautiful_pairs` method efficiently calculates the count of beautiful pairs by leveraging the mathematical relationship between indices and
values in the array.
3. Yes, the code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as described in the system design. The class `BeautifulTriples` and its methods are implemented correctly.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented. There is no missing functionality.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `typing` module is used for type hints, which is sufficient for this implementation.
6. Yes, the methods are self-contained and do not rely on other files. The code does not reuse methods from other files.

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It initializes the `BeautifulTriples` class with test cases, calls its methods, and prints the results.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. It correctly uses the `find_beautiful_pairs` method to compute results for each test case and prints them in the expected format.
3. Yes, the code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as described in the system design. The `Main` class interacts with the `BeautifulTriples` class as per the defined program ca
ll flow.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `main` function is complete and correctly calls the necessary methods from the `BeautifulTriples` class.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `List` and `Tuple` types from `typing` are used correctly, and the `BeautifulTriples` class is imported from `beautiful_trip
les.py`.
6. Yes, methods from `beautiful_triples.py` are being reused correctly. The `find_beautiful_pairs` method is called as intended, and its results are processed and printed.
