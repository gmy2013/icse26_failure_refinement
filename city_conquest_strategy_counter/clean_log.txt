  metagpt.actions.write_prd:run:86 - New requirement detected: [NightHawk22 - Isolation](https://soundcloud.com/vepium/nighthawk22-isolation- official-limbo-remix)⠀This is the hard version of the problem. In the three versions, the constraints on $n$ and the time limit are different. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.This is the statement of Problem D1B:  * There are $n$ cities in a row, numbered $1, 2, \ldots, n$ left to right.     * At time $1$, you conquer exactly one city, called the starting city.      * At time $2, 3, \ldots, n$, you can choose a city adjacent to the ones conquered so far and conquer it. You win if, for each $i$, you conquer city $i$ at a time no later than $a_i$. A winning strategy may or may not exist, also depending on the starting city. How many starting cities allow you to win?For each $0 \leq k \leq n$, count the number of arrays of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ such that  * $1 \leq a_i \leq n$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n$;    * the answer to Problem D1B is $k$. The answer can be very large, so you have to calculate it modulo a given prime $p$. Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 3000$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $p$ ($1 \le n \le 3000$, $10^8 \leq p \leq 10^9$, $p$ is prime) — the number of cities and the modulo.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3000$. For each test case, output $n+1$ integers: the $i$-th integer should be the number of arrays that satisfy the conditions for $k = i-1$.

The main challenge is to count, for each possible number of starting cities k, the number of arrays a_1..a_n (with 1 <= a_i <= n) such that exactly k starting cities allow a winning strategy. We will precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo p for efficient combinatorial calculations. The solution will be modular, separating input parsing, core logic, and output formatting. We will use only the Python standard library (math, sys) and avoid external dependencies for maximum portability and ease of integration with competitive programming platforms. The code will be optimized to handle the sum of n over all test cases up to 3000, using precomputation and memoization where appropriate.","File list":["main.py","conquest_counter.py","combinatorics.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n    class ConquestCounter {\\n        -n: int\\n        -p: int\\n        -fact: list[int]\\n        -inv_fact: list[int]\\n        +__init__(n: int, p: int)\\n        +count_valid_arrays() -> list[int]\\n        +_precompute_factorials() -> None\\n        +_count_for_k(k: int) -> int\\n    }\\n    class Combinatorics {\\n        -p: int\\n        +__init__(p: int)\\n        +modinv(a: int) -> int\\n        +nCr(n: int, r: int) -> int\\n        +precompute_factorials(up_to: int) -> tuple[list[int], list[int]]\\n    }\\n    Main --> ConquestCounter\\n    ConquestCounter --> Combinatorics\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant CC as ConquestCounter\\n    participant C as Combinatorics\\n    M->>M: Parse input (t, test cases)\\n    loop For each test case\\n        M->>CC: __init__(n, p)\\n        CC->>C: __init__(p)\\n        CC->>CC: _precompute_factorials()\\n        CC->>CC: count_valid_arrays()\\n        loop For k in 0..n\\n            CC->>CC: _count_for_k(k)\\n            CC->>C: nCr(n, r)\\n        end\\n        CC-->>M: return list of n+1 answers\\n    end\\n    M->>M: Output results per test case\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The exact combinatorial formula for counting the number of arrays for each k is not fully specified in the requirements and may require further mathematical derivation.
