We leverage the fact that for any subarray, the minimum xor is always achieved by a pair of adjacent elements in the sorted order of the subarray (since xor is minimized for close values). Thus, for each subarray, we only need to consider adjacent pairs in its sorted order. However, iterating over all subarrays is still too slow. Instead, we use a monotonic stack to efficiently find, for each pair of adjacent elements in the original array, the number of subarrays where they are adjacent in the sorted subarray. We collect all such minimum xors and use a heap or sort to find the k-th smallest. For input/output, we use sys.stdin and sys.stdout for speed.
