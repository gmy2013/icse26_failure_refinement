The naive O(n^3) approach is infeasible for large n. Instead, we leverage prefix sums and combinatorial mathematics. The key insight is that for a fixed substring s[l..r], the number of substrings with equal 0s and 1s can be computed using prefix sum differences: we map \'0\' to -1 and \'1\' to +1, and count the number of pairs of indices with the same prefix sum. To efficiently compute the sum over all (l, r), we precompute prefix sums and use a hash map to count occurrences. For all subranges, we use a combinatorial approach: for each position, we count how many times a prefix sum occurs and use combinations to count valid substrings. We use numpy for fast prefix sum computation and collections.Counter for efficient counting. The code is modular, with a core function for the main logic, and is structured for easy integration and testing.
