The core challenge is to compute the minimum number of turns to reduce the boss\'s health to zero, given attacks with individual damages and cooldowns. To achieve optimal performance, we avoid brute-force simulation and instead use a priority queue (heapq) to track the next available turn for each attack. On each turn, we sum the damage of all attacks available at that turn, apply it, and update their next available turn based on cooldowns. We repeat until the boss is defeated. For the CLI, we use standard input/output for batch processing. No external frameworks are needed, but we use Python\'s built-in heapq for efficient event management. The code is modular, separating the core logic (BattleCalculator) from the CLI (main.py).","File list":["main.py","battle_calculator.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class BattleCalculator {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +min_turns_to_defeat(h: int, damages: List[int], cooldowns: List[int]) int\\n    }\\n    class InputParser {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +parse_input() Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int, List[int], List[int]]]]\\n    }\\n    class OutputFormatter {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +format_output(results: List[int]) str\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +run()\\n    }\\n    Main --> InputParser : uses\\n    Main --> BattleCalculator : uses\\n    Main --> OutputFormatter : uses\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant IP as InputParser\\n    participant BC as BattleCalculator\\n    participant OF as OutputFormatter\\n    M->>IP: parse_input()\\n    IP-->>M: t, test_cases\\n    loop for each test_case\\n        M->>BC: min_turns_to_defeat(h, damages, cooldowns)\\n        BC-->>M: turns\\n    end\\n    M->>OF: format_output(results)\\n    OF-->>M: output_str\\n    M->>M: print(output_str)\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The requirements are clear.

The core challenge is to compute the minimum number of turns to reduce the boss\'s health to zero, given attacks with individual damages and cooldowns. To achieve optimal performance, we avoid brute-force simulation and instead use a priority queue (heapq) to track the next available turn for each attack. On each turn, we sum the damage of all attacks available at that turn, apply it, and update their next available turn based on cooldowns. We repeat until the boss is defeated. For the CLI, we use standard input/output for batch processing. No external frameworks are needed, but we use Python\'s built-in heapq for efficient event management.
