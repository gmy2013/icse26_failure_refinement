The core challenge is to maximize the bitwise OR of the sizes of removed subtrees from a forest of rooted trees. We will use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach for each tree: for every node, we compute the size of its subtree and use a set or bitset to track all possible sums of subtree sizes that can be formed by removing disjoint subtrees. For each tree, we will use a variation of the classic subset sum DP (knapsack) to efficiently compute all possible OR values. For the forest, we combine the results from all trees using bitwise OR. We will use Python\'s built-in data structures and the \'sys\' module for fast I/O. No external libraries are required, as the problem is algorithmic and performance-critical, and Python\'s standard library suffices. The code will be modular, with clear separation between input parsing, tree construction, DP computation, and result aggregation.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class ForestProcessor {\\n        +process_test_cases(test_cases: list) -> list\\n        +parse_input(input_lines: list) -> list\\n    }\\n    class Tree {\\n        -n: int\\n        -edges: dict\\n        -subtree_sizes: list\\n        +__init__(n: int, parents: list)\\n        +compute_subtree_sizes() -> None\\n        +get_possible_or() -> int\\n    }\\n    class SubtreeDP {\\n        -n: int\\n        -edges: dict\\n        -dp: set\\n        +__init__(n: int, edges: dict)\\n        +compute() -> set\\n    }\\n    ForestProcessor --> Tree : creates\\n    Tree --> SubtreeDP : uses\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as main.py\\n    participant FP as ForestProcessor\\n    participant T as Tree\\n    participant SD as SubtreeDP\\n    M->>FP: parse_input(input_lines)\\n    FP-->>M: test_cases\\n    M->>FP: process_test_cases(test_cases)\\n    loop for each test_case\\n        FP->>T: __init__(n, parents)\\n        T->>T: compute_subtree_sizes()\\n        T->>SD: get_possible_or()\\n        SD->>SD: compute()\\n        SD-->>T: possible_or_set\\n        T-->>FP: or_value\\n    end\\n    FP-->>M: results (list of max ORs)\\n    M-->>User: print results\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The main ambiguity is whether the subtrees removed must be disjoint (i.e., no overlap in removed nodes) and whether the entire tree can be removed as a single subtree.
