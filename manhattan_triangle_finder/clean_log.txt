    "Implementation approach": "We will design a high-performance, single-file Python solution optimized for competitive programming constraints. The core challenge is to efficiently find
 three distinct points such that all pairwise Manhattan distances are exactly d (even). Brute-force is infeasible due to input size, so we leverage geometric properties: for any point (x,
 y), the set of points at Manhattan distance d forms a diamond. For a triangle with all sides d, the three points must be mutually at distance d, which is only possible if they form an eq
uilateral triangle in the Manhattan metric. For even d, such triangles exist at axis-aligned or diagonal positions. We use a hash map to index points for O(1) lookup, and for each point,
check for the existence of two other points at the required positions. We use only the Python standard library (collections, sys) for speed and simplicity. The code is modular, with clear
 separation between input parsing, triangle search, and output formatting.",

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses only standard Python libraries, is single-file, and follows the described geometric approach for finding Manhattan equilat
eral triangles.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. It checks all valid configurations for three points at the required Manhattan distance, and handles the even/odd d constraint.
3. Yes, the code follows the described data structures and interfaces. The `ManhattanTriangleFinder` class encapsulates the search logic and point indexing, and the `Main` class handles i
nput/output and test case orchestration.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented as described.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies (`collections`, `sys`, `typing`) are imported.
6. Yes, all methods are self-contained within the file and used correctly.
