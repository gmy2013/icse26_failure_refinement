(mmetagpt)  "One day, Zimpha casually came up with a problem. As a member of Zimpha fan club, you decided to solve that problem.
 You are given two strings $s$ and $t$ of length $n$ and $m$, respectively. Both strings only consist of lowercase English letters, - and *. You need to replace all occurrences of * and -
, observing the following rules: * For each -, you must replace it with any lowercase English letter. * For each *, you must replace it with a string of any (possibly, zero) length which
only consists of lowercase English letters. Note that you can replace two different instances of - with different characters. You can also replace each two different instances of * with d
ifferent strings. Suppose $s$ and $t$ have been transformed into $s'$ and $t'$. Now you're wondering if there's a replacement that makes $s'=t'$. The first line of input contains two inte
gers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6$) — the length of the strings $s$ and $t$, respectively. The second line contains the string $s$ of length $n$. It is guaranteed that $s$
 only consists of lowercase English letters, - and *. The third line contains the string $t$ of length $m$. It is guaranteed that $t$ only consists of lowercase English letters, - and *.
For each test case, output Yes if there is a replacement that makes $s'=t'$, and output No otherwise. You can output Yes and No in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES wil
l be recognized as a positive response)."

    "Implementation approach": "We will implement a high-performance string pattern matcher in Python, focusing on efficient linear-time matching to handle very large strings (up to 2 mil
lion characters). The core challenge is to process the two strings with custom wildcards: '-' (single letter) and '*' (arbitrary-length string, possibly empty). We will use a two-pointer
approach, similar to classic wildcard matching algorithms, but adapted for the custom rules. We will avoid regular expressions and instead use direct string traversal for speed and memory
 efficiency. No external libraries are required beyond Python's standard library. The command-line interface will read input, process each test case, and output 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
 Edge cases such as consecutive wildcards and wildcards at string boundaries will be handled explicitly. The system will be designed for easy integration into competitive programming work
flows.",
