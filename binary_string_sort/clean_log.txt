(mmetagpt)  "You are given a binary string$^{\dagger}$. Please find the minimum number of pieces you need to cut it into, so tha
t the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.  Note that: * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the
 original string; * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. $^{\dagger}$ A binary string is a string consisting of characters $\texttt{0}$ and $\texttt{1}$. A sorted binary stri
ng is a binary string such that all characters $\texttt{0}$ come before all characters $\texttt{1}$. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 500$) — the number of te

e string $s$. For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. Example: [ [ "6\n11010\n00
000000\n1\n10\n0001111\n0110", "3\n1\n1\n2\n1\n2" ] ] Note: The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you can't use fewer than $3$ pieces. In the second and
third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so only $1$ piece is needed. In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two characters and rearrange them to
 make the string $\texttt{01}$."
