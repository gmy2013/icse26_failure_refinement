    "Implementation approach": "We will implement an efficient tree dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to solve the 'maximum gold in surviving camps' problem. The core idea is to use DP on trees, where for each camp (node), we compute two values: the maximum gold if the camp is strengthened (and thus its neighbors cannot be), and the maximum gold if it is not strengthened (and its neighbors may be). This is a classic 'maximum weight independent set' problem on trees, with the twist that strengthening a camp subtracts a fixed amount of gold from each neighbor. We will use adjacency lists to represent the tree, and perform a post-order DFS traversal to fill the DP tables. For large input sizes, we will use fast input reading (sys.stdin) and avoid recursion depth issues by using iterative DFS or increasing the recursion limit. No external libraries are needed beyond the Python standard library, ensuring simplicity and maintainability.",

You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English.

The core idea is to use DP on trees, where for each camp (node), we compute two values: the maximum gold if the camp is strengthened (and thus its neighbors cannot be), and the maximum gold if it is not strengthened (and its neighbors may be). This is a classic \'maximum weight independent set\' problem on trees, with the twist that strengthening a camp subtracts a fixed amount of gold from each neighbor. We will use adjacency lists to represent the tree, and perform a post-order DFS traversal to fill the DP tables. For large input sizes, we will use fast input reading (sys.stdin) and avoid recursion depth issues by using iterative DFS or increasing the recursion limit. No external libraries are needed beyond the Python standard library, ensuring simplicity and maintainability.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class CampDefenseSolver {\\n        +__init__()\\n        +solve(test_cases: list) -> list\\n        -_tree_dp(n: int, c: int, gold: list, edges: list) -> int\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> CampDefenseSolver\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Main as Main\\n    participant Solver as CampDefenseSolver\\n    Main->>Main: main()\\n    Main->>Solver: __init__()\\n    Main->>Solver: solve(test_cases)\\n    Solver->>Solver: _tree_dp(n, c, gold, edges)\\n    Solver-->>Main: results (list of int)\\n    Main-->>Main: print results\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The only minor ambiguity is whether two neighboring camps can both be strengthened.
