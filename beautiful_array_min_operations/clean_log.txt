Also, should the solution print all results at once or after each test case? For now, we assume k > 0, array values can be negative, and all results are printed at once as a list."}\n\n## Code Files\n\n\n\n## Code to be Reviewed: main.py\n```Code\n## main.py\n\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\n\nclass BeautifulArraySolver:\n    """Solver for the \'Beautiful Array\' problem.\n\n    Provides methods to compute the minimum number of operations required\n    to make an array palindromic (beautiful) by adding k any number of times\n    to any element, after shuffling.\n    """\n\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        """Initializes the BeautifulArraySolver."""\n        pass\n\n    def min_operations(self, n: int, k: int, arr: List[int]) -> int:\n        """Computes the minimum number of operations to make the array beautiful.\n\n        Args:\n            n: The length of the array.\n            k: The increment value allowed for each operation.\n            arr: The list of integers representing the array.\n\n        Returns:\n            The minimum number of operations required, or -1 if impossible.\n        """\n        # Since shuffling is allowed, we can pair elements optimally.\n        arr_sorted = sorted(arr)\n        total_operations = 0\n\n        # For each pair (i, n-i-1), make them equal by adding k any number of times.\n        for i in range(n // 2):\n            a = arr_sorted[i]\n            b = arr_sorted[n - i - 1]\n            diff = abs(a - b)\n            if diff % k != 0:\n                return -1  # Impossible to make them equal\n            total_operations += diff // k\n\n        return total_operations\n\n    def process_test_cases(\n        self, test_cases: List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]\n    ) -> List[int]:\n        """Processes multiple test cases.\n\n        Args:\n            test_cases: A list of tuples, each containing (n, k, arr).\n\n        Returns:\n            A list of results, one for each test case.\n        """\n        results: List[int] = []\n        for n, k, arr in test_cases:\n            result = self.min_operations(n, k, arr)\n            results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n\nclass InputHandler:\n    """Handles input and output for the Beautiful Array problem."""\n\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        """Initializes the InputHandler."""\n        pass\n\n    def read_input(self) -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]:\n        """Reads input from standard input.\n\n        Returns:\n            A list of test cases, each as a tuple (n, k, arr).\n        """\n        import sys\n\n        input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        test_cases: List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]] = []\n        idx = 0\n        t = int(input_lines[idx].strip())\n        idx += 1\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n_k = input_lines[idx].strip().split()\n            idx += 1\n            n = int(n_k[0])\n            k = int(n_k[1])\n            arr = list(map(int, input_lines[idx].strip().split()))\n            idx += 1\n            test_cases.append((n, k, arr))\n        return test_cases\n\n    def write_output(self, results: List[int]) -> None:\n        """Writes the results to standard output.\n\n        Args:\n            results: A list of integers, each the result for a test case.\n        """\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n\nclass Main:\n    """Main class to run the Beautiful Array solution."""\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def main() -> None:\n        """Main entry point."""\n        input_handler = InputHandler()\n        test_cases = input_handler.read_input()\n        solver = BeautifulArraySolver()\n        results = solver.process_test_cases(test_cases)\n        input_handler.write_output(results)\n\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    Main.main()\n\n```\n\n\n\n# Format example 1\n## Code Review: main.py\n1.
