ider whether to purchase the happiness opportunity or skip it, ensuring that the cost can only be paid from money earned in previous months. The DP state will be defined as dp[i][money],
representing the maximum happiness achievable up to month i with 'money' pounds available. To keep the solution efficient and memory-light, we will use a dictionary to represent only reac
hable states, as the number of months is small (<=50) but the money values can be large. No external open-source libraries are required beyond Python's standard library. The command-line
