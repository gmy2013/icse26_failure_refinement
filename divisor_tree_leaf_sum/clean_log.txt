For i^k, we will precompute i^k for i in 1..n efficiently (using pow with mod). For large n, we will process in blocks or use a sieve-like approach if possible. All arithmetic will be done modulo 10^9+7. The interface will be a simple CLI, reading t test cases and outputting results. We will use Python\'s functools.lru_cache for memoization and sympy\'s divisors function for efficient divisor enumeration, as sympy is a well-maintained open-source library for number theory.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class DivisorTreeSolver {\\n        +MOD: int\\n        +__init__()\\n        +f(x: int, d: int) int\\n        +sum_of_leaves(n: int, k: int, d: int) int\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +run() None\\n    }\\n    Main --> DivisorTreeSolver: uses\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant S as DivisorTreeSolver\\n    M->>S: __init__()\\n    M->>S: sum_of_leaves(n, k, d) for each test case\\n    S->>S: f(x, d) (with memoization)\\n    S->>S: enumerate divisors of x (using sympy.divisors)\\n    S-->>M: return result for each test case\\n    M-->>User: print all results\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The exact mathematical shortcut for f(n, d) is not specified; if d is large, even memoization may not be enough.
