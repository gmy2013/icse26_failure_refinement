In the three versions, the constraints on $n$ and the time limit are different. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.This is the statement of Problem D1B:  * There are $n$ cities in a row, numbered $1, 2, \ldots, n$ left to right.     * At time $1$, you conquer exactly one city, called the starting city.      * At time $2, 3, \ldots, n$, you can choose a city adjacent to the ones conquered so far and conquer it. You win if, for each $i$, you conquer city $i$ at a time no later than $a_i$. A winning strategy may or may not exist, also depending on the starting city. How many starting cities allow you to win?For each $0 \leq k \leq n$, count the number of arrays of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ such that  * $1 \leq a_i \leq n$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n$;    * the answer to Problem D1B is $k$. The answer can be very large, so you have to calculate it modulo a given prime $p$. Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $p$ ($1 \le n \le 500$, $10^8 \leq p \leq 10^9$, $p$ is prime) — the number of cities and the modulo.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $500$. For each test case, output $n+1$ integers: the $i$-th integer should be the number of arrays that satisfy the conditions for $k = i-1$.

We will precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo p for efficient combinatorial calculations. For each test case, we will use DP to count the number of valid arrays for each possible set of starting cities, leveraging symmetry and inclusion-exclusion principles. The code will be modular, with clear separation between input parsing, combinatorial precomputation, DP logic, and output formatting.
