    "Implementation approach": "The main challenge is to efficiently compute the maximum achievable score for each test case, given the unique navigation rules. The problem is a variant of dynamic programming (DP) on a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node (problem) can lead to different next nodes based on the action (submit/skip). To handle large input sizes, we avoid recursion and use iterative DP with precomputed transitions. We use numpy for fast array operations and sys.stdin for fast input. No heavy frameworks are needed; the solution is self-contained and leverages Python's built-in and numpy's efficient data structures. The code is modular, with a clear separation between input parsing, DP computation, and output. The design is extensible for future rule changes.",

The problem is a variant of dynamic programming (DP) on a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node (problem) can lead to different next nodes based on the action (submit/skip). To handle large input sizes, we avoid recursion and use iterative DP with precomputed transitions. We use numpy for fast array operations and sys.stdin for fast input. No heavy frameworks are needed; the solution is self-contained and leverages Python\'s built-in and numpy\'s efficient data structures. The code is modular, with a clear separation between input parsing, DP computation, and output. The design is extensible for future rule changes.","File list":["main.py","olympiad_solver.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class OlympiadSolver {\\n        +solve(test_cases: list[dict]) -> list[int]\\n        -_compute_max_score(n: int, a: list[int], b: list[int]) -> int\\n    }\\n    class InputParser {\\n        +parse_input() -> list[dict]\\n    }\\n    class OutputFormatter {\\n        +format_output(results: list[int]) -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> OlympiadSolver\\n    Main --> InputParser\\n    Main --> OutputFormatter\\n    \\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant IP as InputParser\\n    participant OS as OlympiadSolver\\n    participant OF as OutputFormatter\\n    M->>IP: parse_input()\\n    IP-->>M: test_cases\\n    M->>OS: solve(test_cases)\\n    OS-->>M: results\\n    M->>OF: format_output(results)\\n    OF-->>M: (prints output)\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The optimal DP transition logic is complex and may need further clarification, especially regarding edge cases for problem selection after skip/submit. Memory constraints are not specified, but the design assumes up to 400,000 problems per test case can fit in memory. Parallel processing is not used, as the problem is inherently sequential per test case. If future rules allow more complex navigation, the DP logic may need to be refactored."}\n\n## Task\n{"Required Python packages":["numpy>=1.21.0"],"Required Other language third-party packages":["No third-party dependencies required"],"Logic Analysis":[["olympiad_solver.py","Contains OlympiadSolver class with solve() and _compute_max_score() methods.
