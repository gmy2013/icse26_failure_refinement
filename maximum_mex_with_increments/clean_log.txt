The only minor point is whether to support file input/output or just stdin/stdout; proceeding with stdin/stdout as per requirements."}\n\n## Code Files\n\n\n\n## Code to be Reviewed: main.py\n```Code\n## main.py\n\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom typing import List\n\n\nclass MexCalculator:\n    """Class to compute the maximum MEX for a given array and increment value."""\n\n    def compute_max_mex(self, n: int, x: int, a: List[int]) -> int:\n        """Compute the maximum MEX after any number of increments by x.\n\n        Args:\n            n: The number of elements in the array.\n            x: The increment value.\n            a: The list of integers.\n\n        Returns:\n            The maximum possible MEX.\n        """\n        # Count the frequency of each residue class modulo x\n        residue_count = Counter()\n        for value in a:\n            residue = value % x\n            residue_count[residue] += 1\n\n        # Try to construct the MEX from 0 upwards\n        mex = 0\n        while True:\n            residue = mex % x\n            if residue_count[residue] > 0:\n                residue_count[residue] -= 1\n                mex += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        return mex\n\n\nclass MainApp:\n    """Main application class to handle input/output and invoke MexCalculator."""\n\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        """Initialize the MainApp with a MexCalculator instance."""\n        self.calculator = MexCalculator()\n\n    def run(self) -> None:\n        """Read input, process each test case, and output the result."""\n        import sys\n\n        input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        line_idx = 0\n\n        # Read number of test cases\n        t = 0\n        if line_idx < len(input_lines):\n            t = int(input_lines[line_idx].strip())\n            line_idx += 1\n\n        for _ in range(t):\n            # Read n and x\n            while line_idx < len(input_lines) and input_lines[line_idx].strip() == \'\':\n                line_idx += 1  # Skip empty lines\n            if line_idx >= len(input_lines):\n                break\n            n_x_line = input_lines[line_idx].strip()\n            line_idx += 1\n            n_str, x_str = n_x_line.split()\n            n = int(n_str)\n            x = int(x_str)\n\n            # Read array a\n            a = []\n            while len(a) < n and line_idx < len(input_lines):\n                a_line = input_lines[line_idx].strip()\n                if a_line:\n                    a.extend(map(int, a_line.split()))\n                line_idx += 1\n\n            # Compute and print the result\n            max_mex = self.calculator.compute_max_mex(n, x, a)\n            print(max_mex)\n\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    app = MainApp()\n    app.run()\n\n```\n\n\n\n# Format example 1\n## Code Review: main.py\n1.
