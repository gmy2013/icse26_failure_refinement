It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.  For each testcase, print YES if the arrays $a$ and $b$ can be made the same.

The main ambiguity is whether the operation allows arbitrary permutations (for even n) or is parity-restricted (for odd n). This is clarified by permutation theory. No third-party libraries are needed. If further clarification is needed on the swap operation\'s effect, user should confirm if the above interpretation is correct."}\n\n## Task\n{"Required Python packages":["No third-party dependencies required"],"Required Other language third-party packages":["No third-party dependencies required"],"Logic Analysis":[["main.py","Contains Main class with main() function to handle input/output and test case processing.

The helper method `_get_parity` computes the parity of the permutation required to transform one array into another, which is only relevant for odd n. All logic is contained within `main.py` as per the design.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The swap operation\'s interpretation is based on permutation theory: for even n, any permutation is possible; for odd n, parity must match. If the swap operation allows more than just endpoint swaps or has additional constraints, please clarify."}\n\n## Code Files\n\n\n\n## Code to be Reviewed: main.py\n```Code\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\n\nclass ArrayEqualityChecker:\n    """Class to check if two arrays can be made equal using allowed swap operations."""\n\n    def check_arrays(self, n: int, a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> str:\n        """Check if arrays a and b can be made equal using allowed swaps.\n\n        Args:\n            n: Length of the arrays.\n            a: First array.\n            b: Second array.\n\n        Returns:\n            \'YES\' if arrays can be made equal, \'NO\' otherwise.\n        """\n        # Check if both arrays have the same elements\n        if sorted(a) != sorted(b):\n            return \'NO\'\n\n        # For odd n, check if the parity of the permutation is the same\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            parity_a_to_b = self._get_parity(a, b)\n            if parity_a_to_b != 0:\n                return \'NO\'\n\n        return \'YES\'\n\n    def _get_parity(self, arr: List[int], target: List[int]) -> int:\n        """Compute the parity of the permutation to transform arr into target.\n\n        Args:\n            arr: Source array.\n            target: Target array.\n\n        Returns:\n            0 if the permutation is even, 1 if odd.\n        """\n        # Map value to its index in target\n        value_to_index = {value: idx for idx, value in enumerate(target)}\n        visited = [False] * len(arr)\n        parity = 0\n\n        for i in range(len(arr)):\n            if visited[i] or value_to_index[arr[i]] == i:\n                continue\n            cycle_length = 0\n            j = i\n            while not visited[j]:\n                visited[j] = True\n                j = value_to_index[arr[j]]\n                cycle_length += 1\n            if cycle_length > 0:\n                parity ^= (cycle_length + 1) % 2  # Odd-length cycle flips parity\n\n        return parity\n\n\nclass Main:\n    """Main class to handle input/output and test case processing."""\n\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        self.checker = ArrayEqualityChecker()\n\n    def main(self) -> None:\n        """Main function to process input and output results."""\n        import sys\n\n        input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        t = int(input_lines[0])\n        idx = 1\n\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input_lines[idx])\n            a = list(map(int, input_lines[idx + 1].split()))\n            b = list(map(int, input_lines[idx + 2].split()))\n            idx += 3\n\n            result = self.checker.check_arrays(n, a, b)\n            print(result)\n\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    Main().main()\n\n```\n\n\n\n# Format example 1\n## Code Review: main.py\n1.
