    "Implementation approach": "We will implement a command-line Python application to manage multiple stores and their ice cream inventories. The main challenge is efficiently supporting inventory cloning, insertion, deletion, and fast subset queries (knapsack) under price constraints. We will use Python's built-in data structures and the 'copy' module for efficient deep/shallow copying. Each store's inventory will be a list of (price, tastiness) tuples, supporting O(1) append and pop(0) for oldest removal. For the subset query, we will use a dynamic programming approach (0/1 knapsack) optimized for the small price/tastiness bounds (<=2000) and moderate inventory sizes. To avoid recomputation, we will cache DP results per store and invalidate them on inventory changes. No external frameworks are needed; only standard Python libraries will be used for simplicity and performance.",
