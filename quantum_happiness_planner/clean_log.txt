    "Implementation approach": "The main challenge is efficiently maximizing the number of happiness units Charlie can buy, given the constraints: (1) can only buy one unit per month, (2)
 money earned in month i can only be spent in months j > i, (3) no borrowing, (4) large input sizes. The optimal approach is to process each test case by simulating the accumulation of mo
ney over months, and greedily selecting the cheapest happiness units that can be afforded in future months. To do this efficiently, we process months in reverse, maintaining a running tot
al of available money, and for each month, check if the accumulated money (from previous months) is enough to buy happiness in the current month. We use a simple greedy algorithm with a p
riority queue (heapq from Python standard library) to always select the cheapest available happiness units. No external open-source libraries are needed beyond Python's standard library,
as heapq is sufficient for efficient selection. The command-line interface is minimal, reading input and outputting results as specified.",
