To efficiently compute the number of distinct jobs overlapping with each possible d-day window, we will use a sliding window over the prefix sum array, maintaining a set of job indices currently overlapping the window. However, since we only need the count of distinct jobs overlapping any window, we can preprocess for each job the range of start days where it overlaps with a d-day window, and for each start day, count how many jobs overlap. This can be done efficiently using another difference array over the possible start days. This approach ensures O(n + k) per test case, which is optimal for the constraints. No external libraries are needed beyond Python\'s standard library.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class VisitOverlapOptimizer {\\n        +process_test_case(n: int, d: int, jobs: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> tuple[int, int]\\n        +find_optimal_start_days(n: int, d: int, jobs: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> tuple[int, int]\\n    }\\n    class InputParser {\\n        +parse_input() -> tuple[int, list[tuple[int, int, int, list[tuple[int, int]]]]]\\n    }\\n    class OutputFormatter {\\n        +format_output(results: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> None\\n    }\\n    class Main {\\n        +main() -> None\\n    }\\n    Main --> InputParser\\n    Main --> VisitOverlapOptimizer\\n    Main --> OutputFormatter\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant IP as InputParser\\n    participant VOO as VisitOverlapOptimizer\\n    participant OF as OutputFormatter\\n    M->>IP: parse_input()\\n    IP-->>M: t, test_cases\\n    loop for each test_case\\n        M->>VOO: process_test_case(n, d, jobs)\\n        VOO->>VOO: find_optimal_start_days(n, d, jobs)\\n        VOO-->>M: (brother_start, mother_start)\\n    end\\n    M->>OF: format_output(results)\\n    OF-->>M: None\\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The requirements are clear.
